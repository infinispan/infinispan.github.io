title: Boost Application Performance
---

Infinispan turbocharges applications by storing data closer to processing logic, which reduces latency and increases throughput. 

Available as a Java library, you simply add Infinispan to your application dependencies and then you’re ready to store data in the same memory space as the executing code.

If you want to provision a data layer that is independent of your applications, you can use Infinispan Server for remote access to data with in-memory performance. Clients are a single network hop away from data through consistent hashing techniques and can make requests over HTTP or with a custom binary TCP protocol called Hot Rod.
