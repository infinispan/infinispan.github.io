      With a CacheManager running we can start creating caches and storing data in them. Caches in Infinispan are <i>"named"</i> which means they are identified by a unique name. We are going to enhance the <i>WeatherService</i> implementations from our initial version so that they store the retrieved data in a cache. To do this we will create an intermediate abstract class between the <i>WeatherService</i> interface and the concrete implementations: the <i>CachingWeatherService.</i> This class wraps the expensive remote calls in a method which caches the result returned by the remote call and, before subsequent invocations, checks whether the data is already available locally instead of invoking the expensive remote API. First of all let's obtain our cache:
    </p>
      <pre>
        <code class="java">
          cacheManager.defineConfiguration("weather", new ConfigurationBuilder().build());
          Cache&lt;String, LocationWeather&gt; cache = cacheManager.getCache("weather");
        </code>
      </pre>
    <p>
      We are defining a named cache <i>"weather"</i> using a default configuration, which means a basic local cache. As you can see, the generic types of the keys and values are inferred from the assignment type. Next up, let's see the caching wrapper for the weather retrieval:
    </p>
      <pre>
        <code class="java">
              LocationWeather weather = cache.get(location);
              if (weather == null) {
                weather = fetchWeather(location);
                cache.put(location, weather);
              }
              return weather;
        </code>
      </pre>
    <p>
      Since an Infinispan <i>Cache</i> is an implementation of the <i>java.util.Map</i> interface, the above code should be self explanatory. With the caching in place, let's run the application again, using the usual:
    </p>
      <pre>
        <code class="nohighlight">
          git checkout -f step-2
          mvn clean package exec:exec
        </code>

      You should see the weather conditions displayed twice, but the second run should be several orders of magnitude faster. Good stuff! Entries created above are immortal, i.e. they will exist in the cache until removed. In the next step we will see how to add mortal entries.
