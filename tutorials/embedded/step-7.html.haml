        Now that we know how to react on changes in the cluster topology, we can also react to changes to the data within the cluster. To better show how this work, we will separate
        the roles of our two nodes: the coordinator will take care of putting data in the cache, and the other node will show the cache modifications. 
        %pre
          %code.java
            = preserve do
              :escaped
                @Listener(clustered = true)
                public class CacheListener {
                   @CacheEntryCreated
                   public void entryCreated(CacheEntryCreatedEvent<String, LocationWeather> event) {
                      if (!event.isOriginLocal()) {
                         System.out.printf("-- Entry for %s modified by another node in the cluster\n", event.getKey());
                      }
                   }
                }
        Usually a cache listener only listens to "local events", i.e. events which happen on the same node. For our example, however, we want to listen to events which happen
        on all nodes, and therefore we use the
        %i "clustered = true"
        parameter on the annotation. Let's see the event notifications:

        You'll notice that the coordinator, i.e. the one actually touching the cache, is also logging some events, indicating that another node has modified some entries. This demonstrates the entries
        which are owned by the other node, because of the consistent hashing algorithm. The next step will demonstrate how we can exert some control on the distribution.
