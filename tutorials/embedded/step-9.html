      Now that Infinispan is storing some interesting data, we might want to perform some computation on it. In our weather application, let's compute the average temperature for every country. One simplistic approach would be to have one node perform the computation iterating over the whole dataset. This however has two downsides: it requires fetching the data from the respective owners (which might mean going over the slow network instead of the fast memory) and it only takes advantage of the horsepower of one node, while we have a whole cluster at our disposal. What a waste !
    </p>
    <p>
      Infinispan offers a solution to both problems: using the powerful concepts of distributed execution and distributed streams we can use all the available nodes to perform computation locally to where the data is, and then send the results for aggregation to a master node. Let's see how we can use streams to compute the average country temperature.
    </p>
    <p>
      To compute this we will need to group each of the locations by its country and then average the temperatures within those groupings. This is quite simple with the <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/stream/Stream.html">Streams</a> interface recently added to the JRE.  We can utilize the <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/stream/Stream.html#collect-java.util.stream.Collector-">collect</a> method along with the new <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/stream/Collectors.html">Collectors</a> class to do both of these operations. This is what that would look like:
      <pre>
        <code class="java">
          = preserve do
            :escaped
              public void computeCountryAverages() {
                 Map<String, Double> averages = cache.entrySet().stream()
                         .collect(Collectors.groupingBy(e -> e.getValue().country,
                                 Collectors.averagingDouble(e -> e.getValue().temperature)));
              }
        </code>
      </pre>
      As you can see we are first grouping the elements by the country and then finally averaging the weather within those countries, just like we wanted! And it requires very little code.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unfortunately the above code doesn't work for a distributed cache like we have.  The reason for this is we have to transport the collector operations to each node so they can be processed there.  Thus we have to make sure these are able to be serialized.  Unfortunately the Collectors class doesn't produce instances that are serializable by default.  Therefore Infinispan has a bridge class to support using Collectors, which is aptly named
      <a href="https://docs.jboss.org/infinispan/8.2/apidocs/org/infinispan/stream/CacheCollectors.html">CacheCollectors</a> which allows for the user to provide a serializable <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/function/Supplier.html">Supplier</a> of a Collector.  This can be used like the following:
      <pre>
        <code class="java">
          = preserve do
            :escaped
              public void computeCountryAverages() {
                 Map<String, Double> averages = cache.entrySet().stream()
                         .collect(CacheCollectors(() -> Collectors.groupingBy(e -> e.getValue().country,
                                 Collectors.averagingDouble(e -> e.getValue().temperature))));
              }
        </code>
      </pre>
    </p>
    <p>
      The above code will serialize the supplier of the collector and send that across to the other nodes where it can then create the non serializable Collector locally. This allows for the operations to be executed locally to each entry.
    </p>
    <p>
      That's it ! Let's see it at work
      <pre>
        <code class="nohighlight">
          = preserve do
            :escaped
              $ git checkout -f step-10
              $ mvn clean package exec:exec # on terminal 1
              $ mvn exec:exec # on terminal 2
        </code>
      </pre>
    </p>

      Here is the trimmed output:

      Now that we have a fully working application, which actually does something useful, we might want to run it in production, so we need to find a way to make changing configuration according to the
      environment a bit simpler. On to the next step.
