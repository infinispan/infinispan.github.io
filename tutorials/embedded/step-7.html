    <p>
      Now that we know how to react on changes in the cluster topology, we can also react to changes to the data within the cluster. To better show how this work, we will separate the roles of our two nodes: the coordinator will take care of putting data in the cache, and the other node will show the cache modifications.
    </p>
      <pre>
        <code class="java">
              @Listener(clustered = true)
              public class CacheListener {
                 @CacheEntryCreated
                 public void entryCreated(CacheEntryCreatedEvent<String, LocationWeather> event) {
                    if (!event.isOriginLocal()) {
                       System.out.printf("-- Entry for %s modified by another node in the cluster\n", event.getKey());
                    }
                 }
              }
        </code>
      </pre>
      <p>
      Usually a cache listener only listens to "local events", i.e. events which happen on the same node. For our example, however, we want to listen to events which happen on all nodes, and therefore we use the <i>"clustered = true"</i> parameter on the annotation. Let's see the event notifications:

          git checkout -f step-7
          mvn clean package exec:exec # on terminal 1
          mvn exec:exec # on terminal 2

    <p>
      You'll notice that the coordinator, i.e. the one actually touching the cache, is also logging some events, indicating that another node has modified some entries. This demonstrates the entries which are owned by the other node, because of the consistent hashing algorithm. The next step will demonstrate how we can exert some control on the distribution.
