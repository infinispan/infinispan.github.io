    %h2 Yup, we're open.
    As an open-source project, the Infinispan community has many entry points.
    We welcome your participation however it suits your level of interest.
    %br
    %br
    Infinispan is a 100% open source project, under the Apache Public License 2.0. 
    Not only is the code open source, free to use and free to modify, the development process is also open. 
    Core Infinispan engineers are always available on public IRC channels; hold weekly team meetings in the public; and publish design documents and roadmaps to public wikis. 
    And this is where you can get involved.

    %h2 Everything is on-line
    %p
      Our code is on-line, so is our continuous integration and bug tracker, team meetings are held in public chat rooms, developer discussion mailing lists are public and so are our design wikis.
      It's easy to get involved - just meet one of the core engineers on IRC and say hello.
      Or read

%h2 Disclosure
%p
  We'd like to make clear how this project works and who holds what responsibilities.
  We want everyone involved to understand how decisions are made and where they can contribute.
  If you feel this page does not reflect the current state of project ownership and responsibilities, please contact the project lead on the developers' mailing list.
%h3 Stewardship
%p
  This project is developed and released by Red Hat with assistance from the Java developer community.
  The project lead is appointed by Red Hat, and has the power to accept and reject contributions to the project and set the roadmap.

%h3 Requirement Definition
%p
  The requirements and roadmap for Infinispan are driven by the community. 
  Typically, when a major release is being planned, the project lead will take input from everyone in the community, including the broader JBoss and Red Hat communities, and evaluate what can be done in the necessary time. 
  This will define what features will be addressed in a given release. 
  The project lead will then publish the roadmap on the
  %a{:href => "https://community.jboss.org/wiki/InfinispanRoadmap", :target => "_NEW"} Infinispan public roadmap.
%p
  Infinispan is the base for the 
  %a{:href => "http://www.redhat.com/promo/infspn2jdg/", :target => "_NEW"} JBoss Data Grid
  (JDG), so many requirements for Infinispan are often driven by JDG.
  You can download JDG for free from the 
  %a{:href => "https://access.redhat.com/jbossnetwork/restricted/listSoftware.html?product=data.grid&downloadType=distributions", :target => "_NEW"} Red Hat customer portal.
%p
  The best way for you to suggest requirements for a future release of Infinispan is to enter a feature request in JIRA.
  The Infinispan team uses the JIRA voting system to evaluate the popularity of an issue - lobby others in the community to vote for your feature request!

%h3 Release Cycle
%p
  Infinispan releases major (new features and API changes), minor (new features but no breaking API changes) and micro releases (patches). 
  Once a version of Infinispan is included in a GA JBoss Data Grid release, Infinispan moves on to its next major version. 
  However, Infinispan's regular cadence will ensure that work on the open source version will remain fresh and cutting edge.
  If you are looking for a long term stream of patches, we recommend using 
  %a{:href => "http://www.redhat.com/products/jbossenterprisemiddleware/data-grid/", :target => "_NEW"}JBoss Data Grid.
%h3 Contribution
%p
  Infinispan welcomes, thrives on and greatly values community contribution, and makes the barto contributing as low as possible.

  You are advised to read up on the 
  %a{:href => "/docs/stable/contributing/contributing.html"} Contributing to Infinispan
  page in our documentation before contributing.
  It contains hints and tips on how to write code that will maximize chances for acceptance into the project, as well as many handy tips to help you work with the Infinispan code base.
