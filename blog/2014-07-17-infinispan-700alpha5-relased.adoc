Dear Community,

It is our pleasure to announce the Alpha5 release of Infinispan 7.0.0.
This release includes numerous fixes and enhancements in every area of
Infinispan. This will be our last alpha release as we move into beta
stage and prepare for the final Infinispan 7.0 release.

Major theme of this release is Hot Rod eventing. Java Hot Rod clients
can now subscribe to cache entry created, modified and removed events.
For more details see
 http://infinispan.org/docs/7.0.x/user_guide/user_guide.html#_client_event_listener_api[documentation].
Infinispan Query is now based on Hibernate Search 5; we also use
protoparser lib instead of relying on binary descriptors generated by
protoc. Our JPA cache store works in Karaf; we have also made further
Map/Reduce improvements and bug fixes. Starting with this release
Infinispan server is based on WildFly 8.1 while Hot Rod SASL
implementation supports QOP for encryption.

For a complete list of features and bug fixes included in this release
please refer to
