http://aosabook.org/en/index.html[image:http://aosabook.org/images/posa-cover.png[image,width=242,height=320]]From
the good folks who brought you the
excellent http://aosabook.org/en/index.html[Architecture of Open Source
Applications] (AOSA), available for free online, as a PDF, for e-book
readers or as a good old-fashioned dead tree, we're now treated to a new
tome - the http://aosabook.org/en/index.html[Performance of Open Source
Applications] (POSA).

POSA follows the same concept as AOSA - a different authoritative figure
in the open source community is responsible for each chapter, providing
you with excellent insight on how some of the most popular open source
applications have been designed and built.  POSA focuses specifically on
performance rather than general software architecture, and I've
contributed a chapter on the performance related work conducted for
Infinispan (see http://aosabook.org/en/posa/infinispan.html[Chapter
7]).

Have a read, I'd love to know what you think.

Cheers
Manik
