The initial release of the distributed execution included in Infinispan
5.0 was meant to be more of an experiment -- a testing ground -- rather
than an industrial solution for distributed execution. We provided a
simple
http://docs.jboss.org/infinispan/5.1/apidocs/org/infinispan/distexec/DistributedExecutorService.html[interface]
similar to a familiar
http://docs.oracle.com/javase/1.5.0/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/ExecutorService.html[ExecutorService]
API and adapted it for execution on the Infinispan cluster. To our own
surprise, use of the distributed execution framework took off and people
started using it even in production environments. After the initial
release users enthusiastically provided feedback and asked for
enhancements. Some of these minor enhancements were integrated in
subsequent Infinispan 5.1 and 5.2 releases. However, major improvements
were put aside on a shelf, until now! The time is ripe to respond to
these major enhancements so they can be ready for the Infinispan 6.0
release time. We have started a dedicated design
https://community.jboss.org/wiki/Infinispan60-DistributedExecutionEnhancements[page]
for distributed executor enhancements where you can provide your input
and influence the design of the next iteration of the Infinispan
distributed execution framework. Looking forward to more of your
feedback!
