Last week we showed you
https://blog.infinispan.org/2018/11/the-fastest-path-to-running-infinispan.html[how
to easily run Infinispan on top of OpenShift]. This week we're trying to
do the same on Minikube, a tool that makes it easy to run vanilla
Kubernetes locally.

Although we've already covered the topic in the
https://blog.infinispan.org/2016/08/running-infinispan-cluster-on-kubernetes.html[past],
we felt the descriptors needed a permanent location and an update to the
latest Infinispan releases. Detailed instructions can be found in
https://github.com/infinispan-demos/infinispan-kubernetes[this
repository].

With OpenShift, we took advantage of
https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.11/dev_guide/templates.html[Templates]
which allow a set of objects to be parameterised.
Templates are OpenShift specific, so Kubernetes does not understand
them. Instead, we provide you with the individual descriptors required
to run Infinispan (Helm chart to come...). This includes:


* A
https://github.com/infinispan-demos/infinispan-kubernetes/blob/master/statefulset.yaml[stateful
set]
* Two services, for
https://github.com/infinispan-demos/infinispan-kubernetes/blob/master/service-hotrod.yaml[Hot
Rod] and
https://github.com/infinispan-demos/infinispan-kubernetes/blob/master/service-http.yaml[HTTP
REST] endpoints)
* A
https://github.com/infinispan-demos/infinispan-kubernetes/blob/master/rolebinding.yaml[rolebinding] so
that Kubernetes API can be queried when forming a cluster.
* A
https://github.com/infinispan-demos/infinispan-kubernetes/blob/master/secret.yaml[secret]
for plain authentication.


Before applying the descriptors, download and install
https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/minikube/[Minikube]. Then, set a
profile, select the VM driver, give it enough CPU and memory for your
experiments, and start it.

Once Minikube it's running and you have the corresponding kubectl
command line tool installed, simply call:

$ kubectl apply -f .

Once all pods are ready, you should verify the 3-node cluster has formed
correctly (find out how in the
https://github.com/infinispan-demos/infinispan-kubernetes/blob/master/README.md[README]
file).

When ready, you can start storing and retrieving data. The HTTP REST
endpoint is particularly useful for these initial tests, to verify
everything works as expected:

$ kubectl exec \
  -it infinispan-server-0 \
  -- curl -v -u test:changeme -H 'Content-type: text/plain' -d 'test'
infinispan-server-http:8080/rest/default/stuff

Then:

$ kubectl exec -it infinispan-server-1 \
  -- curl -v -u test:changeme
infinispan-server-http:8080/rest/default/stuff

Go and try it out and let us know what you think. You can find us on
https://infinispan.zulipchat.com/[this Zulip chat] :)

Cheers,
Galder
