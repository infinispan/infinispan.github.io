Infinispan Operator 0.3.0 is now available with expanded configuration
and security options:


=== Container Configuration


With this release of the Infinispan Operator, you can configure explicit
CPU and memory limits for individual containers. The defaults
are 0.5 CPUs and 512Mi of memory.

The Operator also lets you pass extra JVM options, which is useful for
tracking native memory consumption or extra GC logging parameters.




=== Security Configuration


Starting with 0.3.0, credentials are automatically generated for data
connector and management users when you instantiate the Infinispan
Operator.

The default usernames are developer and admin for the data connector
user and management user, respectively.

Generated passwords are stored in Kubernetes
https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/[Secret] instances.
You can extract the passwords as follows:


For convenience, the default usernames are also stored in the secret.
Using the https://stedolan.github.io/jq/[jq] command line tool, you can
inspect both the username and password values with a single command:


If you want to set custom credentials for the data connector and
management users, create Kubernetes Secret instances as follows:


When using a Credentials type authentication, the referenced secrets
must contain username and password fields.


=== Trying It Out!


The easiest way to get started with the Infinispan Operator is via the
https://github.com/infinispan/infinispan-simple-tutorials/tree/master/operator[simple
tutorial]. The Operator is compatible with vanilla Kubernetes
environments, such as Minikube, as well as Red Hat OpenShift.


=== Available via Operator Hub


Install the Infinispan Operator directly from the Operator Hub, which is
available out of the box on all OpenShift 4 versions. If you're using a
vanilla Kubernertes environment, you might need to install the Operator
Lifecycle Manager before you can install via the Operator Hub.

The Infinispan Operator is also included in the community for Kubernetes
Operators is available
from https://operatorhub.io/operator/infinispan[operatorhub.io].


=== What's Next?


The Operator configuration does not yet provide all capabilities
available for Infinispan servers. We're working through a process of
configuration specification that distills the server configuration into
a simple, easy to use, set of configuration options. The current
proposal is being discussed openly
https://github.com/infinispan/infinispan-operator/pull/77[here].

Infinispan 10 brings a brand new server that's no longer based on
WildFly. The Operator 0.x series will remain focused on Infinispan 9.x
server, with Operator 1.x series focusing on Infinispan 10 and
onwards.

Cheers,
