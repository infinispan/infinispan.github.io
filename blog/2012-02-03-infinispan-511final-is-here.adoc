As said earlier this week, based on the feedback we got, we decided to
cut a point release in the 5.1 'Brahma' series, and following Tuesday's
CR1 release, I'm really please to announce the release of Infinispan
5.1.1.FINAL. If you're using 5.1.0.FINAL or any other pre-releases, I'd
strongly recommend that you upgrade to this version.

Full details of what has been fixed can be found
https://issues.jboss.org/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?projectId=12310799&version=12318960[here],
and if you have feedback, please visit our
http://community.jboss.org/en/infinispan?view=discussions[forums].
Finally, as always, you can download the release
from http://www.jboss.org/infinispan/downloads[here].

Cheers,
Galder
