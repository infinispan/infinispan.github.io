Wow, what a week.  We all know Infinispan is sexy and gets a lot of
attention, but the last week has been unprecedented!

The first-ever JUDCon, the developer conference that took place the day
before JBoss World and Red Hat Summit, was great and I look forward to
future JUDCons around the world.  Pics from the first-ever JUDCon are
now http://www.jboss.org/events/JUDCon.html[online], along with some
video interviews with Jason Greene and Pete Muir.

Some of the great presentations at JUDCon include Galder Zamarreño's
talk on Infinispan's Hot Rod protocol (slides
https://www.jboss.org/dms/judcon/presentations/JUDCon2010_HotRodProtocolinInfinispan.pdf[here])
and a talk I did with Mircea Markus on the cache benchmarking framework
and benchmarking Infinispan (slides
https://www.jboss.org/dms/judcon/presentations/JUDCon2010_BenchmarkingAndTestingInfinispan.pdf[here]).

JBoss World/Red Hat Summit was also very interesting.  There is clearly
a lot of excitement around Infinispan, and we heard about interesting
deployments and use cases, lots of ideas and thoughts for further
improvement from customers, contributors and partners.

From JBoss World, there were three talks on Infinispan,
including _Storing Data on Cloud Infrastructure in a Scalable, Durable
Manner_ which I presented along with Mircea Markus
(http://www.redhat.com/promo/summit/2010/presentations/cloud/wed/msurtani-2-storing-data/msurtani-2-storing.pdf[slides]), _Why
RESTful Design for the Cloud is Best_ by Galder Zamarreño
(http://www.redhat.com/promo/summit/2010/presentations/cloud/fri/galder-945-why-RESTful/RestfulDesignJBWRH2010.pdf[slides])
and _Using Infinispan for High Availability, Load Balancing, & Extreme
Performance_ which I presented along with Galder Zamarreño
(http://www.redhat.com/promo/summit/2010/presentations/jbossworld/developer-insights/thurs/msurtani-1130-infinispan/Using-Infinispan-for-High-Availability-Load-Balancing-Extreme-Performance.pdf[slides]).

In addition to the slides, the first talk was even recorded so if you
missed it, you can watch it below:

Further, Infinispan was showcased on Red Hat CTO Brian Stevens' keynote
speech (about 28:15 into the video) where Brian talks about data grids
and their importance, and I demonstrate Infinispan.

We even had an open roadmap and design session for Infinispan 5.0, which
included not just core Infinispan engineers, but contributors, end-users
and anyone who had any sort of interest.  I'll post again later with
details of 5.0 and what our plans for it will be.

For those of you who couldn't make it to JUDCon and JBoss World, hope
the slides and videos on this post will help give you an idea of what
went on.

Cheers
Manik
