This year - as always - Devoxx was a great conference! Not only the
quality of the presentation (including quite some delivered by my
fellows from Red Hat)  but also the chance to meet and discuss with
industry experts. And the
http://www.jroller.com/aalmiray/entry/hackergarten_devoxx_2012[Hackergarten] was
one of the this great networking places.
We had a long chat with https://twitter.com/MariusBogoevici[Marius
Bogoevici] on a nice extension of the
http://www.jboss.org/jdf/examples/ticket-monster/tutorial/Introduction/[Ticket
Monster] Tutorial for Infinispan, so that users looking for an sample
integration application would have a good starting point. Also
http://duncandoyle.blogspot.co.uk/[Duncan Doyle ] contributed a nice
demo of the cross-site replication functionality added in Infinispan 5.2
and https://github.com/gscheibel[Guillaume Scheibel] implemented a

https://github.com/infinispan/infinispan/pull/1473[store extension]:
awesome stuff!
All in all great conference and very good chance for us to get in touch
with our community!
Cheers,
Mircea
