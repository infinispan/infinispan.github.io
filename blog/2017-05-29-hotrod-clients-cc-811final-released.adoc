Dear Infinispanners,

we're pleased to announce that 8.1.1.Final release for C++/C# clients is
out!

Check the
https://issues.jboss.org/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?projectId=12314125&version=12334600[release
notes] and
https://github.com/infinispan/cpp-client/tree/8.1.1.Final[browse the
source code], effort this time has been put in reducing code
complexity.

This is the first release built by our new CI Jenkins environment, this
is supposed to not affect the binaries but if you feel that something
has gone wrong please fill a
https://issues.jboss.org/projects/HRCPP/issues[jira issue].

Enjoy and thanks for reading!

The Infinispan Team
