Dear Infinispanners,

The C++ and C# 8.3.0.Alpha1 releases are available!

Both the clients come with these new features:

* counter operations, to use cluster distributed counters [1]
* admin operations, to create/remove cache programmatically at runtime
[2]

For the .NET Core lovers, there's a work in progress to implement the
dotnet core build for the C# client [3].
Features list, code and bits are available as usual: [4] [5] [6].

Cheers,
The Infinispan Team
