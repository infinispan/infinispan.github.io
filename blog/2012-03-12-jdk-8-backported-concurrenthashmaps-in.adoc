http://g.oswego.edu/[Doug Lea] and the folks on the
http://altair.cs.oswego.edu/mailman/listinfo/concurrency-interest[concurrency-interest
group] have been hard at work on an update of
http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=166[JSR 166] (concurrency utilities) for
Java 8 - called
http://cs.oswego.edu/pipermail/concurrency-interest/2011-July/008084.html[JSR
166e].  These include some pretty impressive changes in a building-block
we've all come to rely pretty heavily on, the
http://docs.oracle.com/javase/1.5.0/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/ConcurrentHashMap.html[ConcurrentHashMap].

One if the big drawbacks in the ConcurrentHashMap, since it was
introduced in Java 5, has always been memory footprint.  It is kinda
bulky, especially when compared to a regular HashMap - 1.6 kb in memory
versus about 100 _bytes_!  Yes, these are for _empty_ maps.

In Java 8, one of the improvements in the ConcurrentHashMap has been
memory footprint - now closer to a regular HashMap.  In addition to
that, the new Java 8 CHM performs better under concurrent load when
compared to its original form.  See
http://concurrency.markmail.org/message/kbqxdfapp5n6u7j3?q=JDK8+CHM[this
discussion] and
http://gee.cs.oswego.edu/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/jsr166/src/jsr166e/ConcurrentHashMapV8.java?revision=1.37&view=markup[comments]
in the proposed ConcurrentHashMapV8 sources for more details.

So, http://www.jboss.org/infinispan/[Infinispan] makes pretty heavy use
of ConcurrentHashMaps internally.  One change in the recently released
http://infinispan.blogspot.com/2012/03/infinispan-512final-is-available-now.html[Infinispan
5.1.2.Final] is these internal CHMs are built using a factory, and we've
included a version of the Java 8 CHM in Infinispan.  So by default,
Infinispan uses the JDK's provided CHM.  But if you wish to force
Infinispan to use the backported Java 8 CHM, all you need to do is
include the following JVM parameter when you start Infinispan:

-Dinfinispan.unsafe.allow_jdk8_chm=true


We'd love to hear what you have to say about this, in terms of memory
footprint, garbage collection and overall performance.  Please use the
Infinispan
https://community.jboss.org/en/infinispan?view=discussions[user forums]
to provide your feedback.

Thanks
