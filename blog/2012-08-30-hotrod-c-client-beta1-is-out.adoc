Thanks to a sustained effort from  http://twitter.com/sunimalr[Sunimal
Rathnayake], the C# HotRod client has evolved quite a bit:


* the public API was polished and finalized
* the client was upgraded to 2nd level of intelligence: that means that
it can automatically piggyback cluster's topology information from the
servers. E.g. if a new server is added, the client is made aware of it
and can start balancing requests towards that server
* a pluggable load balancing policy was added (defaults to round robin) 
* various other bug fixes backed by an growing test suite

We've also set up
https://community.jboss.org/wiki/HotRodCClientDevelopmentSetup[a development
setupiv document] to speed you up in case you want to take a look at the
code or contribute. 

You can download it from
https://github.com/infinispan/dotnet-client/downloads[here] - please
give it a try and don't hesitate to post your comments to our
