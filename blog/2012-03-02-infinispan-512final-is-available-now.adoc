Infinispan 5.1.2.FINAL is out now with a handful of issues fixed that
did not make the previous 5.1.2.CR1. The default JGroups configuration
files shipped by Infinispan have been tweaked to help with state
transfer and the GUI demo should now work in the binaries-only
distribution as well.

Full details of what has been fixed can be found
https://issues.jboss.org/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?projectId=12310799&version=12319012[here],
and if you have feedback, please visit our
https://community.jboss.org/en/infinispan?view=discussions[forums].
Finally, as always, you can download the release from
http://www.jboss.org/infinispan/downloads[here].

Cheers,
Galder
