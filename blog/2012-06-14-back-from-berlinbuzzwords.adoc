I'm back from the berlin [.il]#buzzwords# conference where I've been
talking about the datagrids performance. 
I've been told by several people how good this conference was - but even
so I was very surprised by the quality of both the presenters and
audience. The conference is very focused on data relates topics (scale,
search, store) so it was great picking up the brains of so many data
enthusiasts. The beer wasn't that bad either. 
A big thanks to the organizers for the this excellent event and hope
that [.il]#infinispan# be part of next year's agenda.


Cheers,
Mircea
