I've just returned from http://www.codemotion.it/[Codemotion Rome] where
I delivered a talk on Infinispan. This was my first time presenting
Codemotion: a very big conference with lots of young enthusiasts and
very interesting presentations. A BIG thanks to the organisers for the
excellent job they did and for the opportunity to share so many good
ideas!

Cheers,

Mircea
