As people familiar with C++ and C# Infinispan native clients know, SWIG plays a role in both the projects:</p> </div> <div class="ulist"> <ul> <li> <p>is used to build the base of the C# client wrapping the C++ core with a C# layer;</p> </li> <li> <p>is used in the C project to run (part of) the Java test suite against the client, in this way: a Java wrapper is built via SWIG to make the C client looks like its Java big brother so it can be tested with the Java test suite.</p> </li> </ul> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>The main goal was to produce for a specific language an almost complete client reusing the C++ core features and the following workflow has been setup to do that:</p> </div> <div class="ulist"> <ul> <li> <p>the whole C interface is processed by SWIG. The resulting wrapper exposes almost all the C functions;</p> </li> <li> <p>a user friendly adaptation layer is build on top of the SWIG result.</p> </li> </ul> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>This approach doesn&#8217;t work for the HotSwig goal, mainly because the effort need by the second step is usually not-negligible and prevents the rapid development of prototype in a generic language.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>In the HotSwig approach, this limitation is removed moving the adaptation layer from the target language to the C++ side and then letting SWIG generate a ready to use client prototype. So the HotSwig workflow is the following:</p> </div> <div class="ulist"> <ul> <li> <p>build an adaptation facade around the C core to make it SWIG friendly (do the adaptation work once for all on the C side);</p> </li> <li> <p>explicitly define what we want in the produced SWIG wrapper (keep things simple excluding everything by default);</p> </li> <li> <p>run SWIG to produce the client.</p> </li> </ul> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>At the moment HotSwig is just a proof of concept, but you can try to run it and produce a ready to work Infinispan client for the language you need. Examples are already provided for python, ruby and Octave, but HotSwig should work with all the SWIG supported languages. If you get it to run in your preferred programming language, please share your experience with us.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>I&#8217;ve listed here[3] some tasks for the roadmap, with the idea to test the flexibility of the framework trying to extend it in different directions. Maybe the idea is good and it can grow up from a PoC to something that can really help devs. You can add you ideas of course.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>So if you need to do math against your Infinispan data set why don&#8217;t you try the Octave client? Or maybe you want to do analytics with R, or presentation with PHP. Or you just like parenthesis and you want to use Lisp. Or you&#8217;re working for the Klingon empire and you must use ylDoghQo'[4]&#8230;&#8203; well ok just joking now&#8230;&#8203;</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>Thanks for reading!</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>Cheers The Infinispan Team</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>[1] <a href="https://github.com/rigazilla/hotswig" class="bare">https://github.com/rigazilla/hotswig</a> [2] <a href="http://www.swig.org/" class="bare">http://www.swig.org/</a> [3] <a href="https://github.com/rigazilla/hotswig/issues" class="bare">https://github.com/rigazilla/hotswig/issues</a> [4] <a href="https://www.kli.org/about-klingon/klingon-phrases" class="bare">https://www.kli.org/about-klingon/klingon-phrases</a></p> </div> </div> </div> </div> <hr> <div class="post"></div> <h3> Monday, 02 October 2017 </h3> <h1> <a href="/blog/2017/10/02/better-late-than-never-remote-cache/">Better Late than Never: Remote Cache collections</a> </h1> <div class="content"> <div id="preamble"> <div class="sectionbody"> <div class="paragraph"> <p>One of the main benefits of Infinispan extending the java.util.Map interface when we introduced our <a href="https://docs.jboss.org/infinispan/9.1/apidocs/org/infinispan/Cache.html">Cache</a> interface  was that users would immediately be able to use a well established and familiar API.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>The unfortunate thing about this relationship is that now the Cache interface also has to implement all of the other methods such as keySet, values and entrySet. Originally Infinispan didn&#8217;t implement these collections or returned an immutable copy (requiring all elements to be in memory). Neither choice is obviously desirable.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>This all changed with <a href="https://issues.jboss.org/browse/ISPN-4836">ISPN-4836</a> which provided backing implementations of keySet, values and entrySet collections. This means that all methods were now provided and would keep up to date with changes to the underlying Cache and updates to these collections would be persisted down to the Cache. The implementation also didn&#8217;t keep a copy of all contents and instead allowed for memory efficient iteration. And if the user still wanted to use a copy they could still do that, by iterating over the collection and copying themselves. This later spring boarded our implementation of Distributed Stream as well.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>The problem was that the RemoteCache was left in the old state, where some things weren&#8217;t implemented and others were copies just like how embedded caches used to be.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>Well I can now gladly say with the release of Infinispan 9.1 that RemoteCache now has backing implementations of keySet, values and entrySet implemented via <a href="https://issues.jboss.org/browse/ISPN-7900">ISPN-7900</a>. Thus these collections support all methods on these collections and are backed by the underlying RemoteCache.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>Unfortunately the Stream methods on these collections are not distributed like embedded, but we hope to someday improve that as well. Instead these streams must iterate over the cache to perform the operations locally. By default these will pull 10,000 entries at a time to try to make sure that memory is not overburdened on the client. If you want to decrease this number (less memory - lower performance) or increase (more memory - higher performance) you can tweak this by changing the <strong>batchSize</strong> parameter via <a href="https://docs.jboss.org/infinispan/9.1/apidocs/org/infinispan/client/hotrod/configuration/ConfigurationBuilder.html#batchSize-int-">ConfigurationBuilder</a> or <strong><span class="blob-code-inner">[.pl-c]#infinispan.client.hotrod.batch_Size<mark></strong>[.blob-code-inner]</span>[.pl-c]# if you use a property based file.</mark></p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p><span class="blob-code-inner">[.pl-c]#You can read more about this and the remote iterator which drives these collections on our <a href="http://infinispan.org/docs/stable/user_guide/user_guide.html#remotecache_keyset_entryset_values">user guide</a>. #</span></p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p><span class="blob-code-inner">[.pl-c]#We hope you find that this improves your usage of RemoteCaches in the future by allowing you to have backed collections that also allow you to use the improvements of Java 8 with Streams.</span>#</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p><span class="blob-code-inner">[.pl-c]#If you have yet you can acquire Infinispan 9.1.1 or the latest stable version at <a href="http://infinispan.org/download/" class="bare">http://infinispan.org/download/</a></span>#</p> </div> </div> </div> </div> <hr> <div class="post"></div> <h3> Wednesday, 17 September 2014 </h3> <h1> <a href="/blog/2014/09/17/hot-rod-remote-events-3-customizing/">Hot Rod Remote Events #3: Customizing events</a> </h1> <div class="content"> <div id="preamble"> <div class="sectionbody"> <div class="paragraph"> <p>This blog post is the third in a series that looks at the forthcoming Hot Rod Remote Events functionality included in Infinispan 7.0. In the <a href="http://blog.infinispan.org/2014/08/hot-rod-remote-events-1-getting-started.html">first article</a> we looked at how to get started receiving remote events from Hot Rod servers. In the <a href="http://blog.infinispan.org/2014/08/hot-rod-remote-events-2-filtering-events.html">second article</a>, we saw how Hot Rod remote events can be filtered providing key/value filter factories that can create instances that filter which events are sent to clients, and how these filters can act on client provided information.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>This time we are going to focus on how to customize events sent to clients. Events generated by default contain just enough information to make the event relevant but avoid cramming too much information in order to reduce the cost of sending them. Normally, this information consists of key and type of event.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>Optionally, the information shipped in these events can be customized in order to contain more information, such as values, or to contain even less information. This customization is done with org.infinispan.notifications.cachelistener.filter.CacheEventConverter instances which are created by implementing a org.infinispan.notifications.cachelistener.filter.CacheEventConverterFactory class. Each factory must have a name associated to it via the org.infinispan.filter.NamedFactory annotation.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>When a listener is added, we can provide the name of a converter factory to use with this listener, and when the listener is added, the server will look up the factory and invoke getConverter method to get a org.infinispan.notifications.cachelistener.filter.CacheEventConverter class instance to customize events server side.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>Here&#8217;s a sample implementation which will send custom events containing value information back to clients for a cache of Integers and Strings:</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>In the example above, the converter generates a new custom event which includes the value as well as the key in the event. This will result in bigger event payloads compared with default events, but if combined with filtering, it can reduce its network bandwidth cost.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>In another converter implementation, the user could decide to send back an event that contains no key or event type information. This would result in extremely lightweight events at the expense of richness of information provided by the event itself.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>Plugging the server with this converter requires deploying this converter factory (and associated converter class) within a jar file including a service definition inside the META-INF/services/org.infinispan.notifications.cachelistener.filter.CacheEventConverterFactory file:</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>With the server plugged with the converter, the next step is adding a remote client listener that will use this converter. How to implement a listener for custom events is slightly different to the listeners we&#8217;ve seen in the last couple of blog posts because we know have to deal with customised events as opposed to the default ones. To do so, the same annotations are used as previous blog posts, but the callbacks receive instances of org.infinispan.client.hotrod.event.ClientCacheEntryCustomEvent&lt;T&gt;, where T is the type of custom event we are sending from the server:</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>Now it&#8217;s time to write a simple main java class which adds the remote event listener and executes some operations against the remote cache:</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>Once executed, we should see a console console output similar to this:</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>Similar to events, converters can also act on client provided information, enabling converter instances to customize events depending on the information given when the listener was added. The API provides an extra parameter to pass in converter parameters when the listener is added. Given the similarities with filtering, this part is not covered by this blog post.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>A final note on the marshalling aspects of this example. In order to facilitate both server and client writing against type safe APIs, both the client and server need to be aware of custom event type and be able to marshall it. Client side, this is done by an optional marshaller configurable via the RemoteCacheManager. Server side, this is done by a marshaller recently added to the Hot Rod server configuration.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>In the next blog post in the Hot Rod remote events series, we will look at how to receive remote events in a clustered environment, how to deal with failover situations&#8230;&#8203;etc.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>Cheers, Galder</p> </div> </div> </div> </div> <hr> <div class="post"></div> <h3> Wednesday, 20 August 2014 </h3> <h1> <a href="/blog/2014/08/20/hot-rod-remote-events-2-filtering-events/">Hot Rod Remote Events #2: Filtering events</a> </h1> <div class="content"> <div id="preamble"> <div class="sectionbody"> <div class="paragraph"> <p>This blog post is the second in a series that looks at the forthcoming Hot Rod Remote Events functionality included in Infinispan 7.0. In the <a href="http://blog.infinispan.org/2014/08/hot-rod-remote-events-1-getting-started.html">first blog post</a> we looked at how to get started receiving remote events from Hot Rod servers. This time we are going to focus on how to filter events directly in the server.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>Sending events to remote clients has a cost which increases as the number of clients. The more clients register remote listeners, the more events the server has to send. This cost also goes up as the number of modifications are executed against the cache. The more cache modifications, the more events that need to be sent.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>A way to reduce this cost is by filtering the events to send server-side. If at the server level custom code decides that clients are not interested in a particular event, the event does not even need to leave the server, improving the overall performance of the system.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>Remote event filters are created by implementing a org.infinispan.notifications.cachelistener.filter.CacheEventFilterFactory class. Each factory must have a name associated to it via the org.infinispan.notifications.cachelistener.filter.NamedFactory annotation.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>When a listener is added, we can provide the name of a key value filter factory to use with this listener, and when the listener is added, the server will look up the factory and invoke getFilter method to get a org.infinispan.notifications.cachelistener.filter.CacheEventFilterFactory class instance to filter events server side.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>Filtering can be done based on key or value information, and even based on cached entry metadata. Here&#8217;s a sample implementation which will filter key "2" out of the events sent to clients:</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>Plugging the server with this key value filter requires deploying this filter factory (and associated filter class) within a jar file including a service definition inside the META-INF/services/org.infinispan.notifications.cachelistener.filter.CacheEventFilterFactory file:</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>With the server plugged with the filter, the next step is adding a remote client listener that will use this filter. For this example, we&#8217;ll extend the EventLogListener implementation provided in the <a href="http://blog.infinispan.org/2014/08/hot-rod-remote-events-1-getting-started.html">first blog post</a> in the series and we override the @ClientListener annotation to indicate the filter factory to use with this listener:</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>Next, we add the listener via the RemoteCache API and we execute some operations against the remote cache:</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>If we checkout the system output we&#8217;ll see that the client receives events for all keys except those that have been filtered:</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>Finally, with Hot Rod remote events we have tried to provide additional flexibility at the client side, which is why when adding client listeners, users can provide parameters to the filter factory so that filter instances with different behaviours can be generated out of a single filter factory based on client side information. To show this in action, we are going to enhance the filter factory above so that instead of filtering on a statically given key, it can filter dynamically based on the key provided when adding the listener. Here&#8217;s the revised version:</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>Finally, here&#8217;s how we can now filter by "3" instead of "2":</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>And the output:</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>To summarise, we&#8217;ve seen how Hot Rod remote events can be filtered providing key/value filter factories that can create instances that filter which events are sent to clients, and how these filters can act on client provided information.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>In the next blog post, we&#8217;ll look at how to customize remote events in order to reduce the amount of information sent to the clients, or on the contrary, provide even more information to our clients.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>Cheers, Galder</p> </div> </div> </div> </div> <hr> <div class="post"></div> <h3> Tuesday, 12 August 2014 </h3> <h1> <a href="/blog/2014/08/12/hot-rod-remote-events-1-getting-started/">Hot Rod Remote Events #1: Getting started</a> </h1> <div class="content"> <div id="preamble"> <div class="sectionbody"> <div class="paragraph"> <p>Shortly after the first Hot Rod server implementation was released in 2010, <a href="https://issues.jboss.org/browse/ISPN-374">ISPN-374</a> was created requesting cache events to be forwarded back to connected clients. Even though embedded caches have had access to these events since Infinispan&#8217;s first release, propagating them to remote clients has taken a while, due to the increased complexity involved.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>For Infinispan 7.0, we&#8217;ve finally addressed this. This is the first post in a series that looks at Hot Rod Remote Events and the different functionality we&#8217;ve implemented for this release. On this first post, we show you how to get started with Hot Rod Remote Events with the most basic of examples:</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>Start by downloading the Server distribution for the latest 7.0 (or higher) release from <a href="http://infinispan.org/download/">Infinispan&#8217;s download page</a>. The server contains the Hot Rod server with which the client will communicate. Once downloaded, start it up running the following from the root of the server:</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <div class="title">/bin/standalone.sh</div> <p>Next up, we need to write a little application that interacts with the Hot Rod server. If you&#8217;re using Maven, create an application with this dependency, changing version to 7.0.0.Beta1 or higher:</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>If not using Maven, adjust according to your chosen build tool or download the all distribution with all Infinispan jars.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>With the application dependencies in place, we need to start to write the client application. We&#8217;ll start with a simple remote event listener that simply logs all events received:</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>Now it&#8217;s time to write a simple main java class which adds the remote event listener and executes some operations against the remote cache:</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>Once executed, we should see a console console output similar to this:</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>As you can see from the output, by default events come with the key and the internal data version associated with the current value. The actual value is not shipped back to the client for performance reasons. Clearly, receiving remote events has a cost, and as the cache size increases and more operations are executed, more events will be generated. To avoid inundating Hot Rod clients, remote events can either be filtered server side, or the event contents can be customised. In the next blog post in this series, we will see this functionality in action.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>Cheers, Galder</p> </div> </div> </div> </div> <hr> <div class="post"></div> <h3> Tuesday, 24 April 2012 </h3> <h1> <a href="/blog/2012/04/24/gsoc-and-infinispan/">GSoC and Infinispan</a> </h1> <div class="content"> <div id="preamble"> <div class="sectionbody"> <div class="paragraph"> <p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-1C6R_2PP8fk/UCRNXx3BLyI/AAAAAAAAJ8w/1IYMv5JL2Zk/s1600/GSoC2012_300x200.png"><span class="image"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-1C6R_2PP8fk/UCRNXx3BLyI/AAAAAAAAJ8w/1IYMv5JL2Zk/s200/GSoC2012_300x200.png" alt="image" width="200" height="133"></span></a></p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>I am delighted to announce that one of our submissions for <a href="http://code.google.com/soc/">GSoC</a> was accepted! <a href="http://www.twitter.com/sunimalr">Sunimal Rathnayake</a> will join the infinispan team for implementing a <a href="https://docs.jboss.org/author/display/ISPN/Hot+Rod+Protocol">HotRod</a> client in C#.
