I had the privilege to present "http://www.slideshare.net/gustavonalle/judcon-brazil-2014-lucene-from-bottom-up?qid=116b8a4f-b728-4fde-8c71-46b68ceb4a54&amp;v=qf1&amp;b=&amp;from_search=1[Lucene from the bottom up]" and received many positive feedbacks after the talk, when I had the opportunity to discuss about Lucene usage inside and outside Infinispan.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>I also took the chance to see "Real Time Complex Event Monitoring" delivered by Guna Vijayaratnam showing how to leverage Infinispan in a complex event processing system with real time visualization, a really interesting use case of the Data Grid.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>Overall the conference had a flawless organization with cool technical content, plus a nice venue surrounded by amazing gastronomical offers (picanha anyone?). Combined with the traditional Brazilian hospitality, Judcon Brazil 2014 was a great success, hope to attend again next year !</p> </div> </div> </div> <hr> <div class="post"></div> <h3> Friday, 03 May 2013 </h3> <h1> <a href="/blog/2013/05/03/the-first-judcon-brazil-experience/">The first JUDCon Brazil experience</a> </h1> <div class="content"> <div id="preamble"> <div class="sectionbody"> <div class="paragraph"> <p>The first ever <a href="http://www.jboss.org/events/JUDCon/2013/brazil/">JUDCon Brazil</a> was held a couple of weeks back and it was a real blast! Firstly, it offered a great opportunity to meet some members of the JBoss community which have been helping us push JBoss projects forward in this region of the world, such as <a href="https://twitter.com/hannelita">Hanneli Tavante</a>, <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/wrsantos">Roberto dos Santos Wagner</a>, &#8230;&#8203;etc. It was great sharing ideas, experiences&#8230;&#8203;etc with them and coming up with new ideas!</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>As mentioned before in the post before the conference, I had two new presentations to deliver, one on JSR-107 specification on JCache API and Infinispan&#8217;s implementation, and the other on Hibernate Second Level Cache with Infinispan. The JCache presentation went really well and all the live coding worked as expected.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>The second presentation was the busier of the two, with a full room packed with Hibernate/JPA users waiting to hear how to scale up their applications. I got excellent feedback from both presentations and looking forward to giving these presentations in more user groups or conferences.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>The presentations are not up yet, but I expect them to be posted online in the next few weeks. In the mean time, here are a couple of temporary links to the PDFs of my presentations:</p> </div> <div class="ulist"> <ul> <li> <p>Bolttlenecks are out! Java Cache Standard (JSR-107) is in!

We&#8217;re actively working with them to make the most out of Infinispan :)</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>Cheers, Galder</p> </div> </div> </div> </div> <hr> <div class="post"></div> <h3> Thursday, 18 April 2013 </h3> <h1> <a href="/blog/2013/04/18/infinispan-coming-to-brazils-judcon/">Infinispan coming to Brazil's JUDCon!!</a> </h1> <div class="content"> <div id="preamble"> <div class="sectionbody"> <div class="paragraph"> <p>Infinispan team is coming to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%C3%A3o_Paulo">SÃ£o Paulo</a> (Brazil) to present on multiple topics around caching, data grids and NoSQL in <a href="http://www.jboss.org/events/JUDCon/2013/brazil">Brazil&#8217;s first ever JBoss Users &amp; Developers Conference (JUDCon)</a>. The event is being held over two days, on 19th and 20th of April.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>On the 19th, Manik Surtani and Pete Muir will present on <a href="http://www.jboss.org/events/JUDCon/2013/brazil/speakers.html#maniksurtani1">how to supercharge web applications using JBoss Data Grid</a>. Expect a very lively presentation from these very seasoned presenters :)</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>Another presentation where you&#8217;ll be able to see Infinispan in action is inÂ Shekhar Gulati&#8217;s <a href="http://www.jboss.org/events/JUDCon/2013/brazil/speakers.html#shekhargulati1">"Closed PaaS to Open PaaS : Migrate GAE Applications to OpenShift Using CapeDwarf"</a> and Randall Hauch&#8217;s <a href="http://www.jboss.org/events/JUDCon/2013/brazil/speakers.html#randallhauch1">"Elastic Consistent NoSQL Data Storage with ModeShape 3"</a> talk, both on the 19th of April, where Shekhar and Randal will demonstrate JBoss projects using Infinispan heavily.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>On 20th of April, I&#8217;ll be speaking about <a href="http://www.jboss.org/events/JUDCon/2013/brazil/speakers.html#galderzamerreno2">scaling up Hibernate/JPA applications with Infinispan second-level cache</a>. Even if the Infinispan caching provider was created almost 4 years ago, this is the first time I&#8217;m presenting about it. Really looking forward to that.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>Finally, I&#8217;ll also give the <a href="http://www.jboss.org/events/JUDCon/2013/brazil/speakers.html">first ever presentation on Infinispan JCache (JSR-107) API implementation</a>, which will be mostly a live coding session showing different bits about JCache API and the extra capabilities JCache users get from using Infinispan implementation.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>Cheers, Galder</p> </div> </div> </div> </div> <hr> <div class="post"></div> <h3> Monday, 10 December 2012 </h3> <h1> <a href="/blog/2012/12/10/back-from-judcon-china-2012/">Back from JUDCon China 2012</a> </h1> <div class="content"> <div id="preamble"> <div class="sectionbody"> <div class="paragraph"> <p><a href="http://www.jboss.org/events/JUDCon/2012/china">JUDCon China</a> was held for the first time last week in Beijing, and it was a blast!</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>I had never been to China before, let alone a conference there, so it was interesting to compare it with other conferences around the world. The use of simulaneous translators meant those giving presentations in English had to pace themselves a bit more so that translators would have time to catch up. There&#8217;s was a good bunch of presentation given by native Chinese speakers too, so the audience got the chance to attend more interactive sessions too.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>During this two-day developer conference, I was showing <a href="http://www.jboss.org/events/JUDCon/2012/china/agenda/day1track1.html">Infinispan&#8217;s capabilities as a powerful cache bulding a transactional EE application that neeeded to scale up live</a>. In this presentation, which combines Infinispan with JSF and CDI, I showed how to go from a basic temporary cached, to a clustered cache that used consistent hashing to distribute data, showing the ability to scale up and failover. This presentation which was given shortly after the keynote on the first day generated a lot of interest in the audience, with a lot of users wanting to find out how we compared with other existing cache and data grid providers. This was a great opportunitiy to introduce the rest of Inifnispan talks that were happening that day and the day after, where they could learn more Infinsipan&#8217;s other features as a data grid: i.e. querying, geographic failover&#8230;&#8203;etc.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>My second presentation that same day was about <a href="http://www.jboss.org/events/JUDCon/2012/china/agenda/day1track1.html">querying Infinispan based data grids</a>. The room was packed for this one, and in the presentation I talked about how Infinispan&#8217;s map/reduce functions can take advantage of the paralellism available in cluster to resolve basic queries, and how Infinispan&#8217;s contents can be indexed using the query module and queried via Hibernate Search or Apache Lucene APIs. Finally, I did a little overview of higher level APIs offering further querying possibilities (i.e. ModeShape, Hibernate OGM). As pointed out by Ales, the lead of CapeDwarf team, I somehow forgot to add his project, which offers the possibility of running Google App Engine on top of JBoss Application Server, which uses Infinispan and offers different querying possibilities too. Don&#8217;t worry Ales, we&#8217;ll sort it out for this presentation&#8217;s next outing :)</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>For those who attended, the presentations should be uploaded to the <a href="http://www.jboss.org/events/JUDCon/2012/china">JUDCon China website</a> within the next few weeks.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>Not all was presentations though, we also had the chance to socialise with attendees and other Red Hat employees in China. After all talks finished the first day, Jim Ma and Yong Yang did a fantastics <a href="https://github.com/yongyang/clusterdemo">demo of a cluster of JBoss Application Server 7 instances running on Rasperry PIs</a>,Â and the audience had the opportunity to win one a Rasperry Pi too!</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>If you&#8217;re thinking of going to China, you can&#8217;t leave without trying a hot pot place! On Friday night we went to a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hai_Di_Lao_hot_pot">Hai Dai Lao Hot Pot restaurant</a> for food, and from a culinary perspective, it was the best food I had during my China stay. Hot Pot restaurants have this concept of cooking different meats, vegetables and noodles in two hot pots, one spicy and the other not. On top of that, you get the chance to mix up some cold sauces yourself (sesame oil, coriander, nuts, chillies,,,etc) and mix that with the cooked meat/veg. Unfortunately, one of our colleagues who had a nut allergy had to be rushed to hospital, but it was all Ok in the end :).</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>From here I&#8217;d like to thank Cindy Dong, Jervis Liu, Jim Ma, Christina Lin and many others that helped us, Aliens (according to Chinese Immigration prospects), feel like at home :). Can&#8217;t wait to get back to China.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>Cheers, Galder</p> </div> </div> </div> </div> <hr> <div class="post"></div> <h3> Monday, 05 November 2012 </h3> <h1> <a href="/blog/2012/11/05/infinispan-coming-to-judcon-china-2012/">Infinispan coming to JUDCon China 2012</a> </h1> <div class="content"> <div id="preamble"> <div class="sectionbody"> <div class="paragraph"> <p>The Infinispan team will be well represented in the forthcoming <a href="http://www.jboss.org/events/JUDCon/2012/china">JUDCon China 2012 conference</a> to be celebrated in Beijing on the 29th and 30th of November with no less than <a href="http://www.jboss.org/events/JUDCon/2012/china/agenda">9 talks</a>!</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>We&#8217;ll be covering all sorts of topics: - Building transactional Infinispan applications - Performing rolling upgrades for Infinispan based cluster - Scaling Hibernate/JPA applications using Infinispan-based second level cache - Effective querying of Infinispan data grids - Measuring performance of data grids - &#8230;&#8203;etc</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>So, if you&#8217;re interested in data grids, caching or Infinispan, come and <a href="http://www.jboss.org/events/JUDCon/2012/china/register">join us</a>!!Â It&#8217;s gonna be a fun a couple of days.

The talks ranged from high level overviews and roadmaps to detailed, hands-on hacking sessions, as well as presenting thoughts and ideas for future development.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>All in, an excellent community conference, well organised by <a href="http://www.saltmarch.com/">Saltmarch Media</a>, and very well received by the community. I for one look forward to another JUDCon in Bangalore in the hopefully not too distant future.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>Cheers Manik</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>PS: After writing this, I noticed that Galder has blogged about <a href="http://infinispan.blogspot.com/2012/01/judcon-india-post-mortem.html">JUDCon India</a> too!</p> </div> </div> </div> </div> <hr> <div class="post"></div> <h3> Wednesday, 25 January 2012 </h3> <h1> <a href="/blog/2012/01/25/judcon-india-post-mortem/">JUDCon India post-mortem</a> </h1> <div class="content"> <div id="preamble"> <div class="sectionbody"> <div class="paragraph"> <p><a href="http://www.jboss.org/events/JUDCon/2012/india">JUDCon India</a> is finished now and I was hugely impressed with what I saw in the conference. First of all, it was by far the biggest crowd I&#8217;ve seen in a JUDCon event so that&#8217;s excellent news. The more, the merrier :)</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>The attendants have been excellent and in general I felt that they were paying more attention than in conferences in other countries. This is partly because hardly any attendant had their laptops open while listening to the presentations. They simply had a notebook and a pen or pencil and they were taking just notes. I wished this would happen more often in other conferences. Hmmm, time to ban laptops in non-interactive presentations?</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>I ended up doing <a href="http://www.jboss.org/events/JUDCon/2012/india/agenda">4 presentations</a>, 3 of them in Infinispan related topics and 1 talking about JBoss Polyglot. Of all, the one that I felt attracted the most attention was the one on near caches. I got a lot of positive feedback from attendants and very interesting questions at the end of the presentation.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>In terms of organization, it was impecable. Wifi worked like a treat with around 7 access points, 3/4 of which you could join from any place in the conference. Food was good as well, if you like Indian cooking of course :). As I already said on <a href="http://twitter.com/galderz">Twitter</a>, the toilets were&#8230;&#8203; interesting for a westener :).</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>Finally, I must congratulate the organisers on the method used to motivate attendants to provide feedback on the presentations. To get the JUDCon t-shirt, attendants needed to fill in feedback forms for all presentations they had attended, and once the last presentation had finished, they could go and claim their t-shirt once they&#8217;d handed over the feedback forms. I thought this was a fantastic idea to increase the amount of feedback received. So, well done to organisers!

Â And wow what a week it was too; I work with some brilliant minds. Â Massively inspiring and innovative people.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>JUDCon started well, at the World Trade Centre in Boston. Â With over 200 people attending, it was the largest JUDCon we&#8217;ve ever done, with three parallel tracks of some of the coolest tech, many by non-Red Hat employees. Â With regards to Infinispan, Mircea did a <a href="http://www.jboss.org/events/JUDCon/day2track2.html#930AM">deep-dive</a>Â covering how Infinispan works "under the hood". Â Sanne did a talk on <a href="http://www.jboss.org/events/JUDCon/day2track2.html#230PM">advanced querying across a data grid</a>, including making use of map/reduce techniques. Â I delivered a talk specifically on <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/maniksurtani/mapreduce-in-the-cloud-infinispan-distributed-task-execution-framework">map/reduce and distributed code execution</a> across Infinispan nodes - a talk I delivered on behalf of Vladimir as he sadly couldn&#8217;t make the event due to personal reasons. Â The first day ended in a pizza-and-beer-fuelled hackathon that went on till 2am. Â Hopefully this will give you an idea of what JUDCon is all about, including the quality and focus of talks, and whet your appetite - make you want to attend the next such event. Â :-) Â Trust me, for techies, there&#8217;s no better way of immersing yourself in it.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p><a href="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5069/5696495944_d93a64e89c.jpg"><span class="image"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5069/5696495944_d93a64e89c.jpg" alt="image" width="213" height="320"></span></a></p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>And then there was JBoss World. Â As many in the industry keeps saying, JBoss has got its mojo back. Â Coolness reminiscent of Marc Fleury&#8217;s early <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/06_15/b3979098.htm">bad-boy JBoss</a> - a poke in the eye of establishment, disruptive and brazen, JBoss has gone back to its roots. Â Craig Muzilla talked numbers and new products, Mark Little talked about his vision of ubiquitous computing andÂ <a href="http://community.jboss.org/blogs/mark.little/2011/05/08/jboss-everywhere">JBoss Everywhere</a>, and then the much tweeted, much talked-about demo started. Â Many said we were nuts to try and pull off a live demo of such scale and complexity - let me put it this way, we had no backup. Â :-) I&#8217;m not going to spoil the demo for you, a recording of the keynote including the demo is <a href="http://vimeo.com/24798138">here</a>Â (the demo starts 39 minutes into the video).</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>Demos aside, JBoss World/Summit was an excellent event. Â The biggest of its kind to date, I presented on <a href="http://www.redhat.com/summit/2011/presentations/jbossworld/decoding_the_code/wednesday/surtani_w_1400_Highly_Scalable_Data_Grids_and_Distributed_Caching_with_Infinispan.pdf">use cases and design patterns</a> involving Infinispan, Bela spoke about <a href="http://www.redhat.com/summit/highlights/">geographic failover</a>Â (click on the JBoss World tab for the video). Â Sanne and Emmanuel talked about <a href="http://www.redhat.com/summit/2011/presentations/jbossworld/whats_new/wednesday/bernard_w_420_jpa_in_hibernate.pdf">Hibernate OGM</a>, the ultra-cool JPA layer over Infinispan that so many people want to get their hands on. Â Craig Bomba from <a href="http://www.cboe.com/">CBOE</a> - the largest options exchange in the world - talked about going live with Infinispan, stressing on keeping close to the community, participating and being "good open source citizens". Â Something we all applaud.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>But for many folks, the biggest thing was the announcement of the <a href="http://www.jboss.com/edg6-early-access">JBoss Enterprise Data Grid platform</a>. Â A fully supported data grid, based on Infinispan. Â This enables users to buy production support, consultancy and training around Infinispan. Â The announcement even made its way to the <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/PR-CO-20110503-906624.html">Wall Street Journal</a>, among many other illustrious publications!</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>So now with all the adrenalin - and <a href="http://cocktails.about.com/od/atozcocktailrecipes/r/old_fshned_cktl.htm">old-fashioneds</a> at our favourite bar, <a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/drink-boston-2">Drink</a> - of last week behind me, it&#8217;s time to focus on getting Infinispan 5.0 into a stable state and cutting what will be the fastest, most feature-rich and ultimately usable Infinispan release ever.
