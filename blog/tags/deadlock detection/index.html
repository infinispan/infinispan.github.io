Second transaction (<em>T2</em>) writes to key b and a - again order is relevant. Now with some "right timing" <em>T1</em> manages to acquire lock on <em>a</em> and <em>T2</em> acquires lock on b. And then they wait one for the other to release locks so that they can progress. This is what is called a deadlock and is really bad for your system throughput - but I won&#8217;t insist on this aspect, as I&#8217;ve mentioned it a lot in my previous posts.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>What I want to talk about though is a way to solve this problem. Quit a simple way - just force an order on your transaction writes and you&#8217;re guaranteed not to deadlock: if both <em>T1</em> and <em>T2</em> write to a then <em>b (</em>lexicographical order) there won&#8217;t be any deadlock. Ever.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>But there&#8217;s a catch. It&#8217;s not always possible to define this order, simply because you can&#8217;t or because you don&#8217;t know all your keys at the very beginning of the transaction.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>Now here&#8217;s the good news: Infinispan orders the keys touched in a transaction for you. And it even defines an order so that you won&#8217;t have to do that. Actually you don&#8217;t have to anything, not even enable this feature, as it is already enabled for you by default.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>Does it sound too good to be true? That&#8217;s because it&#8217;s only partially true. That is lock reordering only works if you&#8217;re using optimistic locking. For pessimistic locking you still have to do it the old way - order your locks (that&#8217;s of course if you can).</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>Wanna know more about it? Read <a href="http://community.jboss.org/wiki/LockReorderingForAvoidingDeadlocks">this</a>.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>Expect and enjoy this feature in our next release 5.1.0.BETA5.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>Stay tunned!</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>Mircea</p> </div> </div> </div> </div> <hr> <div class="post"></div> <h3> Wednesday, 09 November 2011 </h3> <h1> <a href="/blog/2011/11/09/single-lock-owner-important-step/">Single lock owner: an important step forward</a> </h1> <div class="content"> <div id="preamble"> <div class="sectionbody"> <div class="paragraph"> <p>The single lock owner is a highly requested Infinispan improvement. The basic idea behind it is that, when writing to a key, locks are no longer acquired on all the nodes that own that key, but only on a single designated node (named "main owner").</p> </div> </div> </div> <div class="sect1"> <h2 id="_how_does_it_help_me"><a class="anchor" href="#_how_does_it_help_me"></a>How does it help me?</h2> <div class="sectionbody"> <div class="paragraph"> <p>Short version: if you use transactions that concurrently write to the same keys, this improvement significantly increases your system' throughput.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>Long version: If you&#8217;re using Infinispan with transactions that modify the same key(s) concurrently then you can easily end up in a deadlock. A deadlock can also occur if two transaction modify the same key at the same time - which is both inefficient and counter-intuitive. Such a deadlock means that at one transaction(or both) eventually rollback but also the lock on the key is held for the duration of a lockAquistionTimout config option (defaults to 10 seconds). These deadlocks reduces the throughput significantly as transactions threads are held inactive during deadlock time. On top of that, other transactions that want to operate on that key are also delayed, potentially resulting in a cascade effect.</p> </div> </div> </div> <div class="sect1"> <h2 id="_whats_the_added_performance_penalty"><a class="anchor" href="#_whats_the_added_performance_penalty"></a>What&#8217;s the added performance penalty?</h2> <div class="sectionbody"> <div class="paragraph"> <p>The only encountered performance penalty is during cluster topology changes. At that point the cluster needs to perform some additional computation (no RPC involved) to fail-over the acquired locks from previous to new owners. Another noticeable aspect is that locks are now being released asynchronously, after the transaction commits. This doesn&#8217;t add any burden to the transaction duration, but it means that locks are being held slightly longer. That&#8217;s not something to be concerned about if you&#8217;re not using transactions that compete for same locks though. We plan to benchmark this feature using <a href="http://radargun.sourceforge.net/">Radargun</a> benchmark tool - we&#8217;ll report back!</p> </div> </div> </div> <div class="sect1"> <h2 id="_want_to_know_more"><a class="anchor" href="#_want_to_know_more"></a>Want to know more?</h2> <div class="sectionbody"> <div class="paragraph"> <p>You can read the <a href="http://community.jboss.org/wiki/SingleNodeLockingModel">single lock owner design wiki</a> or/and follow the JIRA <a href="https://issues.jboss.org/browse/ISPN-1137">JIRA</a> discussions.</p> </div> </div> </div> </div> <hr> <div class="post"></div> <h3> Monday, 03 October 2011 </h3> <h1> <a href="/blog/2011/10/03/transaction-remake-in-infinispan-51/">Transaction remake in Infinispan 5.1</a> </h1> <div class="content"> <div id="preamble"> <div class="sectionbody"> <div class="paragraph"> <p>If you ever used Infinispan in a transactional way you might be very interested in this article as it describes some very significant improvements in version 5.1 "Brahma" (released with 5.1.Beta1):</p> </div> <div class="ulist"> <ul> <li> <p>starting with this release an Infinispan cache can accessed either transactionally or non-transactionally. The mixed access mode is no longer supported (backward compatibility still maintained, see below). There are <a href="http://www.cis.upenn.edu/acg/papers/cal06_atomic_semantics.pdf">several reasons</a> for going this path, but one of them most important result of this decision is a cleaner semantic on how concurrency is managed between multiple requestors for the same cache entry.</p> </li> <li> <p>starting with 5.1 the supported transaction models are <strong>optimistic</strong> and <strong>pessimistic</strong>. Optimistic model is an improvement over the existing default transaction model by completely deferring lock acquisition to transaction prepare time. That reduces lock acquisition duration and increases throughput; also avoids deadlocks. With pessimistic model, cluster wide-locks are being acquired on each write and only being released after the transaction completed (see below).</p> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> <div class="sect1"> <h2 id="_transactional_or_non_transactional_cache"><a class="anchor" href="#_transactional_or_non_transactional_cache"></a>Transactional or non transactional cache?</h2> <div class="sectionbody"> <div class="paragraph"> <p>It&#8217;s up to you as an user to decide weather you want to define a cache as transactional or not. By default, infinispan caches are non transactional. A cache can be made transactional by changing the <em>transactionMode</em> attribute:</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p><em>transactionMode</em> can only take two values: <em>TRANSACTIONAL</em> and <em>NON_TRANSACTIONAL</em>. Same thing can be also achieved programatically:</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p><strong>Important:</strong>for transactional caches it is required to <a href="https://docs.jboss.org/author/x/FAY5">configure a TransactionManagerLookup</a>.</p> </div> </div> </div> <div class="sect1"> <h2 id="_backward_compatibility"><a class="anchor" href="#_backward_compatibility"></a>Backward compatibility</h2> <div class="sectionbody"> <div class="paragraph"> <p>The <em>autoCommit</em> attribute was added in order to assure backward compatibility. If a cache is transactional and <em>autoCommit</em> is enabled (defaults to true) then any call that is performed outside of a transaction&#8217;s scope is transparently wrapped within a transaction. In other words Infinispan adds the logic for starting a transaction before the call and committing it after the call. So if your code accesses a cache both transactionally and non-transactionally, all you have to do when migrating to Infinispan 5.1 is mark the cache as transactional and enable <em>autoCommit</em> (that&#8217;s actually enabled by default, so just don&#8217;t disable it :) The <em>autoCommit</em> feature can be managed through configuration:</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>or programatically:</p> </div> </div> </div> <div class="sect1"> <h2 id="_optimistic_transactions"><a class="anchor" href="#_optimistic_transactions"></a>Optimistic Transactions</h2> <div class="sectionbody"> <div class="paragraph"> <p>With optimistic transactions locks are being acquired at transaction prepare time and are only being held up to the point the transaction commits (or rollbacks). This is different from the 5.0 default locking model where local locks are being acquire on writes and cluster locks are being acquired during prepare time.

That is because the optimistic transactions rollback if data has changed between the time it was read and the time it was committed (<em>writeSkewCheck</em>). On the other hand, pessimistic transactions might be a better fit when there is high contention on the keys and transaction rollbacks are less desirable. Pessimistic transactions are more costly by their nature: each write operation potentially involves a RPC for lock acquisition.</p> </div> </div> </div> <div class="sect1"> <h2 id="_the_path_ahead"><a class="anchor" href="#_the_path_ahead"></a>The path ahead</h2> <div class="sectionbody"> <div class="paragraph"> <p>This major transaction rework has opened the way for several other transaction related improvements:</p> </div> <div class="ulist"> <ul> <li> <p><a href="http://community.jboss.org/wiki/SingleNodeLockingModel">Single node locking model</a> is a major step forward in avoiding deadlocks and increasing throughput by only acquiring locks on a single node in the cluster, disregarding the number of redundant copies (<em>numOwners</em>) on which data is replicated</p> </li> <li> <p><a href="http://community.jboss.org/wiki/LockReorderingForAvoidingDeadlocks">Lock acquisition reordering</a> is a deadlock avoidance technique that will be used for optimistic transactions</p> </li> <li> <p><a href="http://community.jboss.org/wiki/IncrementalOptimisticLocking">Incremental locking</a> is another technique for minimising deadlocks.</p> </li> </ul> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>Stay tuned!

It is about increasing the number of transactions that can be concurrently processed. Let&#8217;s start with the problem first (the deadlock) then discuss some design details and performance.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>So, the by-the-book deadlock example is the following:</p> </div> <div class="ulist"> <ul> <li> <p>Transaction one (T1) performs following operation sequence: (write key_1,write key_2)</p> </li> <li> <p>Transaction two (T2) performs following sequence: (write key_2, write key_1).</p> </li> </ul> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>Now, if the T1 and T2 happen at the same time and both have executed first operation, then they will wait for each other virtually forever to release owned locks on keys. In the real world, the waiting period is defined by a lock acquisition timeout (LAT) - which defaults to 10 seconds - that allows the system to overcome such scenarios and respond to the user one way (successful) or the other(failure): so after a period of LAT one (or both) transaction will rollback, allowing the other to continue working.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>Deadlocks are bad for both system&#8217;s throughput and user experience. System throughput is affected because during the deadlock period (which might extend up to LAT) no other thread will be able to update neither key_1 nor key_2. Even worse, access to any other keys that were modified by T1 or T2 will be similarly restricted. User experience is altered by the fact that the call(s) will freeze for the entire deadlock period, and also there&#8217;s a chance that both T1 and T2 will rollback by timing out.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>As a side note, in the previous example, if the code running the transactions would(and can) enforce any sort of ordering on the keys accessed within the transaction, then the deadlock would be avoided. E.g. if the application code would order the operation based on the lexicographic ordering of keys, both T1 and T2 would execute the following sequence: (write key_1,write key_2), and so no deadlock would result. This is a best practice and should be followed whenever possible. Enough with the theory! The way Infinispan performs deadlock detection is based on an algorithm designed by <a href="http://www.jboss.org/community/people/jason.greene%40jboss.com">Jason Greene</a> and <a href="http://www.jboss.org/community/people/manik.surtani%40jboss.com">Manik Surtani</a>, which is detailed <a href="http://www.jboss.org/index.html?module=bb&amp;op=viewtopic&amp;p=4244838#4244838">here</a>. The basic idea is to split the LAT in smaller cycles, as it follows:</p> </div> <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre class="CodeRay highlight"><code data-lang="java">lock(<span class="type">int</span> lockAcquisitionTimeout) {&#x000A;  <span class="keyword">while</span> (currentTime &lt; startTime + timeout) {&#x000A;   <span class="keyword">if</span> (acquire(smallTimeout)) <span class="keyword">break</span>;&#x000A;   testForDeadlock(globalTransaction, key);&#x000A;  }&#x000A;  }</code></pre> </div> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>What testForDeadlock(globalTransaction, key) does is check weather there is another transaction that satisfies both conditions:</p> </div> <div class="olist arabic"> <ol class="arabic"> <li> <p>holds a lock on key and</p> </li> <li> <p>intends to lock on a key that is currently called by this transaction.</p> </li> </ol> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>If such a transaction is found then this is a deadlock, and one of the running transactions will be interrupted: the decision of which transaction will interrupt is based on coin toss, a random number that is associated with each transaction. This will ensure that only one transaction will rollback, and the decision is deterministic: nodes and transactions do not need to communicate with each other to determine the outcome.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>Deadlock detection in Infinispan works in two flavors: determining deadlocks on transactions that spread over several caches and deadlock detection in transactions running on a single(local) cache.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>Let&#8217;s see some performance figures as well. A class for benchmarking performance of deadlock detection functionality was created and can be seen <a href="http://viewvc.jboss.org/cgi-bin/viewvc.cgi/infinispan/trunk/core/src/test/java/org/infinispan/profiling/DeadlockDetectionPerformanceTest.java?view=markup">here</a>. Test description (from javadoc):</p> </div> <div class="quoteblock"> <blockquote> <div class="paragraph"> <p>We use a fixed size pool of keys (KEY_POOL_SIZE) on which each transaction operates. A number of threads (THREAD_COUNT) repeatedly starts transactions and tries to acquire locks on a random subset of this pool, by executing put operations on each key. If all locks were successfully acquired then the tx tries to commit: only if it succeeds this tx is counted as successful. The number of elements in this subset is the transaction size (TX_SIZE). The greater transaction size is, the higher chance for deadlock situation to occur. On each thread these transactions are being repeatedly executed (each time on a different, random key set) for a given time interval (BENCHMARK_DURATION). At the end, the number of successful transactions from each thread is cumulated, and this defines throughput (successful tx) per time unit (by default one minute).</p> </div> </blockquote> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>Disclaimer: The following figures are for a scenario especially designed to force very high contention. This is not typical, and you shouldn&#8217;t expect to see this level of increase in performance for applications with lower contention (which most likely is the case). Please feel free tune the above benchmark class to fit the contention level of your application; sharing your experience would be very useful!</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>Following diagram shows the performance degradation resulting from running the deadlock detection code by itslef in a scenario where no contention/deadlocks are present. <a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_ISQfVF8ALAQ/Sm2hy99CLHI/AAAAAAAABp4/VNnd1p70YW8/s1600-h/DLD_local.JPG"><span class="image"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_ISQfVF8ALAQ/Sm2hy99CLHI/AAAAAAAABp4/VNnd1p70YW8/s400/DLD_local.JPG" alt="image"></span></a>http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_ISQfVF8ALAQ/Sm2h_re8qKI/AAAAAAAABqA/bsNgEyCkcYw/s1600-h/DLD_replicated.JPG[<span class="image"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_ISQfVF8ALAQ/Sm2h_re8qKI/AAAAAAAABqA/bsNgEyCkcYw/s400/DLD_replicated.JPG" alt="image"></span>]<a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_ISQfVF8ALAQ/Sm2iMq08ZjI/AAAAAAAABqI/Fn049-27Bts/s1600-h/DLD_enabling_overhead.JPG"><span class="image"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_ISQfVF8ALAQ/Sm2iMq08ZjI/AAAAAAAABqI/Fn049-27Bts/s400/DLD_enabling_overhead.JPG" alt="image"></span></a> Some clues on when to enable deadlock detection. A high number of transaction rolling back due to org.infinispan.util.concurrent.TimeoutException is an indicator that this functionality might help. TimeoutException might be caused by other causes as well, but deadlocks will always result in this exception being thrown. Generally, when you have a high contention on a set of keys, deadlock detection may help. But the best way is not to guess the performance improvement but to benchmark and monitor it: you can have access to statistics (e.g. number of deadlocks detected) through JMX, as it is exposed via the DeadlockDetectingLockManager MBean.</p> </div> </div> </div> </div> <hr> <div class="pagination-links"><span class="current-page">1</span> </div> </div> <footer class="container"> <hr> <div class="row"> <div class="col-md-2 col-md-offset-1"> <h4>Navigate</h4> <ul> <li> <a href="/about" title="About">About</a> </li> <li> <a href="/documentation" title="Learn">Learn</a> </li> <li> <a href="/community" title="Community">Community</a> </li> <li> <a href="/getinvolved" title="Get Involved">Get Involved</a> </li> <li> <a href="/download" title="Download">Download</a> </li> </ul> </div> <div class="col-md-2"> <h4>Contribute</h4> <ul> <li> <a href="https://issues.jboss.org/browse/ISPN" title="Submit a bug">Submit a bug</a> </li> <li> <a href="https://github.com/infinispan" title="Write code">Write Code</a> </li> </ul> <h4>Follow Us</h4> <ul> <li> <a href="https://blog.infinispan.org" title="Blog">Blog</a> </li> <li> <a href="https://twitter.com/infinispan" title="Twitter">Twitter</a> </li> </ul> </div> <div class="col-md-2"> <h4>Open Source</h4> <p> Infinispan is released under the <b>Apache 2.0 open source license.</b> Learn more about the Apache 2.0 license <a href="https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0">here.</a> </p> </div> <div class="col-md-2"> <h4>A member of</h4> <a alt="CloudTM" href="http://www.cloudtm.eu/" target="_NEW"> <img src="/images/cloudtm.png"> </a> <a alt="LEADS" href="http://leads-project.eu/" target="_NEW"> <img src="/images/leads.png"> </a> <a alt="CloudButton" href="http://cloudbutton.eu/" target="_NEW"> <img src="/images/cloudbutton.png"> </a> </div> <div class="col-md-2"> <h4>Thanks to</h4> <p>JetBrains Intellij IDEA</p> <a alt="JetBrains Intellij IDEA" href="https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/" target="_NEW"> <img src="/images/icon_IntelliJIDEA.png"> </a> </div> </div> <div class="col-md-10"> <p style="margin-top: 5px; font-size: 80%;"> © Copyright 2009-2019 Red Hat, Inc. <br> <i class="icon-fire"></i> Made with <a href="https://github.com/jbossorg/bootstrap-community" style="text-decoration: underline;" target="_NEW">JBoss Community Bootstrap</a> and <a href="http://awestruct.org/" style="text-decoration: underline;" target="_NEW">Awestruct</a> <br> <i class="icon-globe"></i> This website is open source!
