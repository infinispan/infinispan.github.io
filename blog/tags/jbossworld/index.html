Heiko Rupp and I were speaking about "Effectively Manage &amp; Monitor Red Hat JBoss Data Grid Nodes" where we presented <a href="http://www.redhat.com/products/jbossenterprisemiddleware/data-grid/">JDG</a> and <a href="http://www.redhat.com/products/jbossenterprisemiddleware/operations-network/">JON</a> at a high level and then we showed a demo of both products interacting with each other. The presentation&#8217;s slides are now <a href="http://rhsummit.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/zamarreno_data_grids.pdf">available for download</a>.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>I was not the only one speaking about JBoss Data Grid. Both Manik, the Infinispan project lead, and Alan Santos, the product manager for Infinispan, were also delivering talks on JBoss Data Grid. Although their presentations are not up yet, you&#8217;ll be able to download them from <a href="http://www.redhat.com/summit/2012/presentations/jbossworld/">here</a>.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>I also met some Infinispan customers, such as Erik who&#8217;s been using Infinispan at a well known telecommunications company, or two of the lead technical guys at a well known Geneva bank. We had some great conversations where we were able to synch up our roadmap with them to make sure any requirements they had are met in the future.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>Of the presentations I attended, I was particularly impressed by Pete and Marius' 10 minute demo on going from 0 to a fully fledged mobile application running on top of AS7 in OpenShift in the "What&#8217;s New in Java Frameworks for Web, Cloud, &amp; Mobile" BOF. I hope it was recorded cos it was very impressive stuff.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>It was a great week and once again it was a pleasure to be part of the Red Hat Summit and JBoss World :)</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>Cheers,</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>Galder</p> </div> </div> </div> </div> <em>Posted by Galder Zamarreño on 2012-07-09</em> <br> <em>Tags:</em> <a href="/blog/tags/conference/"> conference </a> <a href="/blog/tags/jdg/"> jdg </a> <a href="/blog/tags/event/"> event </a> <a href="/blog/tags/jbossworld/"> jbossworld </a> <div class="post"></div> <h3> Thursday, 09 June 2011 </h3> <h1> <a href="/blog/2011/06/09/keynote-of-decade-behind-scenes/">Keynote of the decade: behind the scenes, an Infinispan perspective</a> </h1> <div class="content"> <div id="preamble"> <div class="sectionbody"> <div class="paragraph"> <p><a href="http://www.redhat.com/summit/">JBoss World 2011</a>'s much talked about keynote ended with a big bang - a live demo that many thought we were insane to even try and pull off - and has sparked off a lot of interest, many claiming JBoss <em>has got its mojo back</em>.  One of the things people keep asking is, what actually went on?  How did we build such a demo?  How can we do the same?</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-BU_Th8gwcGQ/Te_F39JVgLI/AAAAAAAABfg/lFNL0VBpmIw/s1600/Screen+shot+2011-06-08+at+19.55.50.png"><span class="image"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-BU_Th8gwcGQ/Te_F39JVgLI/AAAAAAAABfg/lFNL0VBpmIw/s320/Screen+shot+2011-06-08+at+19.55.50.png" alt="image" width="320" height="240"></span></a>Firstly, if you did not attend the keynote or did not watch it online, I recommend that you <strong>stop reading this now, and go and watch the keynote.</strong> <a href="http://www.jboss.org/jbw2011keynote">A recording is available online</a> (the demo starts at about minute 35).</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>Ok, now that you&#8217;ve been primed, lets talk about the role Infinispan played in that demo.  The demo involved reading mass volumes of real-time data off a Twitter stream, and storing these tweets in an Infinispan grid. This <em>primary grid</em> (known as Grid-A), and ran off 3 large rack-mount servers. The Infinispan nodes were standalone, bootstrapped off a simple Main class, and formed a cluster, running in asynchronous <a href="http://community.jboss.org/docs/DOC-14853#distribution">distributed mode</a> with 2 data owners.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>Andrew Sacamano did an excellent job of building an HTML 5-based webapp to visualise what goes on in such a grid, making use of <a href="http://community.jboss.org/docs/DOC-14871">cache listeners</a> pushing events to browsers and browsers rendering the "spinning spheres" using HTML 5&#8217;s canvas tag.  So now we could visualise data and data movement within a grid of Infinispan nodes.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-72Xfg5uM8Bk/Te_GgGQ4pQI/AAAAAAAABfk/ZphDf8ES4R8/s1600/Screen+shot+2011-06-08+at+19.58.06.png"><span class="image"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-72Xfg5uM8Bk/Te_GgGQ4pQI/AAAAAAAABfk/ZphDf8ES4R8/s320/Screen+shot+2011-06-08+at+19.58.06.png" alt="image" width="320" height="214"></span></a>As Twitter data started to populate the grid, we fired up a second grid (Grid-B) consisting of 8 nodes. Again, these nodes were configured using asynchronous distribution and 2 data owners, but this time these nodes were running on very small and cheap plugtop computers.  These plugtops - <a href="http://www.globalscaletechnologies.com/t-guruplugdetails.aspx">GuruPlugs</a> - are constrained devices with 512MB of RAM, a 1GHz ARM processor.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>Yes, your iPhone has more grunt :-) And yes, these sub-iPhone devices were running a real data grid!</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>The purpose of this was to demonstrate the extremely low footprint and overhead Infinispan imposes on your hardware (we even had to run <a href="http://today.java.net/pub/a/today/2009/05/21/zero-and-shark-openjdk-port.html">the zero assembly port of OpenJDK</a>, an interpreted-mode JVM, since the processor only had a 16-bit bus!). We also had a server running JBossAS running Andrew&#8217;s cool visualisation webapp rendering the contents of Grid-B, so people could "see" the data in both grids.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>We then fired up <a href="http://www.jboss.org/drools">Drools</a> to have it mine the contents of Grid-A and send it to Grid-B applying some rules to select the interesting tweets, namely the ones having the hashtag <strong>#JBW</strong>. With this in place, we then invited the audience to participate - by tweeting with hashtag #JBW, as well as the hashtag of your favourite JBoss project - e.g., #infinispan :-)  People were allowed to vote for more than one project, and the most prolific tweeter was to win a prize.  This started a frenzy of tweeting, and was reflected in the two grid visualisations.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>Not only Infinispan is very quick here: needless to say, Drools was sending the tweets from Grid-A to Grid-B using <a href="http://www.jboss.org/hornetq">HornetQ</a>, the fastest JMS implementation on the planet.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>Jay Balunas of <a href="http://www.jboss.org/richfaces">Richfaces</a> built a TwitterStream app with live updates of these tweets for various devices, including iPhones, iPads, Android phones and tablets, and of course, desktop web browsers, grabbing data off Grid-B.  Christian Sadilek and Mike Brock from the <a href="http://www.jboss.org/errai">Errai</a> team also built a tag-cloud application visualising popular tags as a tag cloud, again off Grid-B, making use of Errai to push events to the browser.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>After simulating Mark Proctor to try cheating the system with a script, we could recover the correct votes: clear Grid-B, update the Drools rules to have it discard the cheat tweets, and have a cleaned up stream of tweets flow to Grid-B.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>All applications, including Drools and the visualizations, where using a JPA interface to store or load the tweets: it was powered by an early preview of <a href="http://community.jboss.org/docs/DOC-16273">HibernateOGM</a>, which aims to abstract any NoSQL store as a JPA persistence store while still providing some level of consistency. As HibernateOGM is not feature complete, it was using <a href="http://search.hibernate.org/">Hibernate Search</a> to provide query capabilities via a Lucene index, and using the Infinispan integration of Hibernate Search to distribute the index on Infinispan.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>We then demonstrated failover, as we invited the winner to come up on stage to choose and brutally un-plug one of the plugtops of his choice from Grid-B - this plugtop became his prize. Important to note, the webapps running off the grid did not risk to lose any data, Drools pulling stuff off Grid-A onto Grid-B was still able to continue running, the Lucene index could continually be updated and queried by the remaining nodes.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>From an Infinispan perspective, what did this demo make use of?</p> </div> <div class="ulist"> <ul> <li> <p>Data distribution, numOwners = 2</p> </li> <li> <p>Async network communication via <a href="http://jgroups.org/">JGroups</a></p> </li> <li> <p>JTA integration with <a href="http://www.jboss.org/jbosstm">JBossTS</a></p> </li> <li> <p><a href="http://community.jboss.org/docs/DOC-14871">Cache listeners</a> to notify applications of changes in data and topology</p> </li> <li> <p>The <a href="http://community.jboss.org/docs/DOC-14332">Infinispan Lucene Directory</a> distributing the Lucene index on the grid</p> </li> </ul> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>So a fairly simple setup, using simple embeddable components, cheap hardware, to build a fairly complex application with excellent failover and scalability properties.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>So we where depending on wi-fi connectivity, internet access, a live tweet stream, technology previews and people&#8217;s cooperation!</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>To make things more interesting, the day before the demo one of the servers died; hardware failure: didn&#8217;t survive the trip. A second server, meant to serve the UI webapps, started reporting failures on all network interfaces just before starting the demo: it could not figure out hardware addresses of cluster peers, and we had no time to replace him: its backup was already dead. Interesting enough we could tap in some advanced parameters of the JGroups configuration to workaround this issue.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p><a href="http://in.relation.to/service/File/13429"><span class="image"><img src="http://in.relation.to/service/File/13429" alt="image" width="200" height="194"></span></a>Nothing was pre-recorded! Actually the backup plan was to have Mark Little dancing a tip-tap; next year we will try to stretch our demo even more so you might see that dance!</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>So here you can see the recording of the event: <a href="http://www.jboss.org/jbw2011keynote" class="bare">http://www.jboss.org/jbw2011keynote</a> or listen to the <a href="http://bit.ly/lELbAy">behind the scenes podcast</a>.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>After the demo, we did hear of a large commercial application using Infinispan and Drools in precisely this manner - except instead of Twitter, the large data stream was flight seat pricing, changing dynamically and constantly, and eventually rendered to web pages of various travel sites - oh, and they weren&#8217;t running on plugtops in case you were thinking ;)  So, the example isn&#8217;t completely artificial.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>How do you use Infinispan?  We&#8217;d love for you to share stories with us.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>Cheers</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>Manik and Sanne</p> </div> </div> </div> </div> <em>Posted by Manik Surtani on 2011-06-09</em> <br> <em>Tags:</em> <a href="/blog/tags/jbossworld/"> jbossworld </a> <a href="/blog/tags/demo/"> demo </a> <div class="post"></div> <h3> Monday, 09 May 2011 </h3> <h1> <a href="/blog/2011/05/09/jboss-world-and-judcon-2011-recap/">JBoss World and JUDCon 2011 recap</a> </h1> <div class="content"> <div id="preamble"> <div class="sectionbody"> <div class="paragraph"> <p>So I finally get to recap on <a href="http://www.jboss.org/events/JUDCon">JUDCon</a> in Boston and <a href="http://www.redhat.com/summit/">JBoss World/Red Hat Summit</a> from last week.  And wow what a week it was too; I work with some brilliant minds.  Massively inspiring and innovative people.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>JUDCon started well, at the World Trade Centre in Boston.  With over 200 people attending, it was the largest JUDCon we&#8217;ve ever done, with three parallel tracks of some of the coolest tech, many by non-Red Hat employees.  With regards to Infinispan, Mircea did a <a href="http://www.jboss.org/events/JUDCon/day2track2.html#930AM">deep-dive</a> covering how Infinispan works "under the hood".  Sanne did a talk on <a href="http://www.jboss.org/events/JUDCon/day2track2.html#230PM">advanced querying across a data grid</a>, including making use of map/reduce techniques.  I delivered a talk specifically on <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/maniksurtani/mapreduce-in-the-cloud-infinispan-distributed-task-execution-framework">map/reduce and distributed code execution</a> across Infinispan nodes - a talk I delivered on behalf of Vladimir as he sadly couldn&#8217;t make the event due to personal reasons.  The first day ended in a pizza-and-beer-fuelled hackathon that went on till 2am.  Hopefully this will give you an idea of what JUDCon is all about, including the quality and focus of talks, and whet your appetite - make you want to attend the next such event.  :-)  Trust me, for techies, there&#8217;s no better way of immersing yourself in it.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p><a href="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5069/5696495944_d93a64e89c.jpg"><span class="image"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5069/5696495944_d93a64e89c.jpg" alt="image" width="213" height="320"></span></a></p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>And then there was JBoss World.  As many in the industry keeps saying, JBoss has got its mojo back.  Coolness reminiscent of Marc Fleury&#8217;s early <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/06_15/b3979098.htm">bad-boy JBoss</a> - a poke in the eye of establishment, disruptive and brazen, JBoss has gone back to its roots.  Craig Muzilla talked numbers and new products, Mark Little talked about his vision of ubiquitous computing and <a href="http://community.jboss.org/blogs/mark.little/2011/05/08/jboss-everywhere">JBoss Everywhere</a>, and then the much tweeted, much talked-about demo started.  Many said we were nuts to try and pull off a live demo of such scale and complexity -

the largest options exchange in the world - talked about going live with Infinispan, stressing on keeping close to the community, participating and being "good open source citizens".  Something we all applaud.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>But for many folks, the biggest thing was the announcement of the <a href="http://www.jboss.com/edg6-early-access">JBoss Enterprise Data Grid platform</a>.  A fully supported data grid, based on Infinispan.  This enables users to buy production support, consultancy and training around Infinispan.  The announcement even made its way to the <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/PR-CO-20110503-906624.html">Wall Street Journal</a>, among many other illustrious publications!</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>So now with all the adrenalin -
