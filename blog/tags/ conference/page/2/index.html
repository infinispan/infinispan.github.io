Fastest ever conference video release I&#8217;ve seen! Kudos to <a href="https://berlinbuzzwords.de/">Berlin Buzzwords</a> üëè</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>The <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/galderz/big-data-in-action-1">slides</a> for the talk can be found here, and the video is here:</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>Berlin Buzzwords was a very interesting conference. Similar to <a href="https://jonthebeach.com/">J On The Beach</a>, it&#8217;s a conference focused on data related technologies, but Berlin Buzzwords had a more Apache focus. So, you had many talks on Solr, Lucene, Spark, Flink, Kafka, Beam&#8230;&#8203;etc, as well as Apache spinoffs such as ElasticSearch.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>The conference was very well organised and the talks were good, although I did miss some demos in the talks I attended. Having been presenting Infinispan for over 8 years, I am fully aware that coming up with data related demos is not an easy task. However, with some many open data streams available these days, there has never been a bigger opportunity to put some of that data to work in a live demo and demonstrate why your tech is so awesome.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>From an Infinispan perspective, it was fascinating talking to Flink, Beam&#8230;&#8203;etc developers and learn how Infinispan could be integrated with these projects. We already have Hadoop and Spark integrations, but we&#8217;re not standing still and we will continue to integrate with other popular data processing technologies.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>On a personal level, it was awesome to meet <a href="https://spark-summit.org/2016/speakers/william-benton/">William Benton</a> once again and we had some very interesting discussions about <a href="https://radanalytics.io/">Radanalytics</a>, a project that helps you build data-driven applications on top of OpenShift. I also had some interesting chats with fellow Basel residents working for Baloise insurance group and the University of Basel.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>Cheers, Galder</p> </div> </div> </div> </div> <hr> <div class="post"></div> <h3> Tuesday, 13 June 2017 </h3> <h1> <a href="/blog/2017/06/13/infinispan-coming-to-berlin-buzzwords/">Infinispan coming to Berlin Buzzwords 2017</a> </h1> <div class="content"> <div id="preamble"> <div class="sectionbody"> <div class="paragraph"> <p>Are you attending Berlin Buzzwords and want to find out more how Infinispan can help your systems react to real-time data quickly, and see the cool stuff we have for data analytics, make sure you come to my talk on <a href="https://berlinbuzzwords.de/17/session/big-data-action-infinispan">Big Data In Action with Infinispan</a> on Tuesday, 13th June at 16:30.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p><a href="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-IlsBC3ZCCcY/WT-s53YRLLI/AAAAAAAAE3U/I5ogdn0fmBcXbzcHJKD4wWj85TGp5WqVACLcB/s1600/buzzwords_2017.png"><span class="image"><img src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-IlsBC3ZCCcY/WT-s53YRLLI/AAAAAAAAE3U/I5ogdn0fmBcXbzcHJKD4wWj85TGp5WqVACLcB/s320/buzzwords_2017.png" alt="image" width="320" height="119"></span></a></p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>Cheers, Galder</p> </div> </div> </div> </div> <hr> <div class="post"></div> <h3> Sunday, 21 May 2017 </h3> <h1> <a href="/blog/2017/05/21/j-on-beach-unmissable-conference-for/">J On The Beach: An unmissable conference for distributed computing tech!</a> </h1> <div class="content"> <div id="preamble"> <div class="sectionbody"> <div class="paragraph"> <p><a href="https://jonthebeach.com/">J On The Beach</a> was a blast! It&#8217;s only their second year doing the conference, but it was really well managed and it had an amazing lineup of speakers. To top that up, it was in Malaga so the good weather made it possible to stay outside in the garden at <a href="http://www.latermicamalaga.com/">La Termica</a> chatting to attendees and speakers.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>The evening before the start of the conference, we had a welcome reception at the Ayuntamiento de Malaga learning about IT and Big Data promotion that the major and his team are helping with.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>The conference started with a mind-blowing keynote on quantum computing by <a href="https://www.dwavesys.com/our-company/leadership">Eric Ladizinsky</a>. It was a super talk with very interesting information about what the future might hold in terms of computing. The challenges of quantum computing are immense but the possibilities it opens up staggering as well.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>That first morning I had the chance to see¬†<a href="https://aphyr.com/about">Kyle Kingsbury</a>'s <a href="https://github.com/jepsen-io/jepsen">Jepsen</a> talk which was very entertaining. He gave an intro on Jepsen and looked back at the results of different distributed environments. This allowed the audience to get a good overview on what each system is capable of and what guarantees they provide. Also in the first day I attended, <a href="http://christophermeiklejohn.com/">Christopher Meiklejohn</a>'s talk on <a href="http://syncfree.github.io/antidote/">Antidote</a>, a geo-replicated NoSQL database with strong guarantees based on Riak. It uses CRDTs and Hight Available Transactions to achieve this.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>On the second day I had my presentation on Functional Reactive Programming with Elm, Node.js and Infinispan. It was well received and got good feedback. Slides can be found <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/galderz/learn-how-to-build-functional-reactive-applications-with-elm-node-dot-js-and-infinispan-2">here</a>, and the demo repository is <a href="https://github.com/galderz/infinispan-events/tree/mid17">here</a>. Unfortunately, due to scheduling and preparations for my talk, I couldn&#8217;t go to Duarte Dunes' <a href="http://www.scylladb.com/">ScyllaDB</a> and Tyler Akidau&#8217;s <a href="https://beam.apache.org/">Apache Beam</a> talks, but I hope to catch those up when the videos are shared.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>However, I was able to attend <a href="https://twitter.com/caitie">Caitie Mccaffrey</a>'s talk on <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/caitiem20/distributed-sagas-a-protocol-for-coordinating-microservices">Distributed Sagas, a protocol for coordinating microservices</a>. Even though such protocol would be hard to implement in all situations, e.g. online ticket shop for a very popular artist, it had some interesting characteristics. The talk itself was delivered masterfully.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>Finally, I was at¬†<a href="https://twitter.com/mjpt777">Martin Thompson</a>'s High Performance Managed Languages talk which was superb! With years of experience and the development of Aeron on his back, he was able to give a interesting overview of the performance characteristics of managed vs unmanaged languages. Flexibility in managed languages, such as in C#, seems to be the best way to achieve the best performance.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>All in all it was a fantastic conference, and I was delighted to have been part of it. <a href="https://valo.io/">Valo</a>, the company behind J On The Beach were fantastic hosts and met some amazing people that are or had been part of this company, including: Luis, Justo, Michael, Danielle&#8230;&#8203;etc.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>I hope to come up another time :)</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>Cheers, Galder</p> </div> </div> </div> </div> <hr> <div class="post"></div> <h3> Thursday, 18 May 2017 </h3> <h1> <a href="/blog/2017/05/18/infinispan-landed-in-j-on-beach-2017/">Infinispan landed on J On The Beach 2017</a> </h1> <div class="content"> <div id="preamble"> <div class="sectionbody"> <div class="paragraph"> <p>Are you in Malaga for <a href="https://jonthebeach.com/">J On The Beach 2017</a>¬†and want to know more about functional reactive programming with Elm, Node.js and Infinispan?

Emmanuel and I would like to thank all attendees to our <a href="http://cfp.devoxx.fr/2017/talk/UKK-0693/Architecture_par_la_pratique:_patterns_d%E2%80%99utilisation_de_systemes_in-memory_-_WD-40_entre_vos_donnees_et_vos_applis">in-memory data grids patterns</a> talk. The room was full and we thoroughly enjoyed the experience!</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>During the talk we presented a couple of small demos that showcased some in-memory data grid use cases. The demos are located <a href="https://github.com/galderz/datagrid-patterns">here</a>, but I thought it&#8217;d be useful to provide some <a href="https://github.com/galderz/datagrid-patterns">step-by-step</a> here so that you can get them running as quickly as possible.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>Before we start with any of the demos, it&#8217;s necessary to run some set up steps:</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>¬† 1. Check out git repository:</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>¬† ¬† git clone <a href="https://github.com/galderz/datagrid-patterns" class="bare">https://github.com/galderz/datagrid-patterns</a></p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>¬† 2. Download <a href="http://downloads.jboss.org/infinispan/9.0.0.Final/infinispan-server-9.0.0.Final-bin.zip">Infinispan Server 9.0.0.Final</a> and at the same level as the git repository.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>¬† 3. Go into the datagrid-patterns directory, start the servers and wait until they&#8217;ve started:</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>¬† ¬† cd datagrid-patterns ¬† ¬† ./run-servers.sh</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>¬† 4. Install <a href="https://www.continuum.io/downloads">Anaconda for Python 3</a>, this is required to run Jupyter notebook for plotting.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>¬† 5. Install <a href="https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi">Maven 3</a>.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>Once the set up is complete, it&#8217;s time to start with the individual demos.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>Both demos shown below work with the same application domain: rail transport systems. In this domain, we differentiate between physical stations, trains, station boards which are located in stations, and finally stops, which are individual entries in station boards.</p> </div> </div> </div> <div class="sect2"> <h3 id="_analytics_demo"><a class="anchor" href="#_analytics_demo"></a>Analytics Demo</h3> <div class="paragraph"> <p>The first demo is focused on how you can use Infinispan for doing offline analytics. In particular, this demo tries to answer the following question:</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p><em>Q. What is the time of the day when there is the biggest ratio of delayed trains?</em></p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>To answer this question, Infinispan data grid will be loaded with 3 weeks worth of data from station boards. Once the data is loaded, we will execute a remote server task which will use <a href="http://infinispan.org/docs/stable/user_guide/user_guide.html#streams">Infinispan Distributed Java Streams</a> to calculate the two pieces of information required to answer the question: per hour, how many trains are going through the system, and out of those, how many are delayed.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>An important aspect to bear in mind about this server tasks is that it will only be executed in one of the nodes in the cluster. It does not matter which one. In turn, this node will will ship the lambdas required to do the computation to each of the nodes so that they can executed against their local data. The other nodes will reply with the results and the node where the server task was invoked will aggregate the results.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>Then, these results are sent back to the client, which in turn, stores the results as JSON in an intermediate cache. Once the results are in place, we will use a Jupyter notebook to read those results and plot the result.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>Let&#8217;s see these steps in action:</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>¬† 1. First, we need to install the server tasks in the running servers above:</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>¬† ¬† cd datagrid-patterns/analytics</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>¬† ¬†¬†mvn clean install package -am -pl analytics-server</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>¬† ¬†¬†mvn wildfly:deploy -pl analytics-server</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>¬† ¬†¬†</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>¬† 2. Open the datagrid-pattern repo with your favourite IDE and run <strong>delays.java.stream.InjectApp</strong>¬†class located in analytics/analytics-server project. This command will inject the data into the cache. On my environment, it takes between 1 and 2 minutes.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>¬† 3. With the data loaded, we need to run the remote task that will calculate the total number of trains per hour and how many of those are delayed. To do that, execute <strong>delays.java.stream.AnalyticsApp</strong> class located in analytics/analytics-server project from your IDE.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>¬† 4. You can verify that the results have been calculating by going to the following address:</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>¬† ¬†¬†<a href="http://localhost:8180/rest/analytics-results/results" class="bare">http://localhost:8180/rest/analytics-results/results</a></p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>¬† 5. With the results in place, it&#8217;s time to start the Jupyter notebook:</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>¬† ¬† cd datagrid-patterns/analytics/analytics-jupyter</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>¬† ¬†¬†~/anaconda/bin/jupyter notebook</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>¬† 6. Once the notebook opens, click open <strong>live-demo.ipynb</strong>¬†notebook and execute each of the cells in order.

What is the time of the day when there is the biggest ratio of delayed trains?</em></p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>is <strong>2am</strong>! That&#8217;s because last connecting trains of the day wait for each other to avoid leaving passengers stranded.</p> </div> </div> <div class="sect2"> <h3 id="_real_time_demo"><a class="anchor" href="#_real_time_demo"></a>Real Time Demo</h3> <div class="paragraph"> <p>The second demo that we presented uses the same application domain as above, but this time we&#8217;re trying to use our data grid as a way of storing the station board state of each station at a given point in time. So, the idea is to use Infinispan as an in memory data grids for working with real time data.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>So, what can we do with this type of data? In our demo, we will create a centralised dashboard of delayed trains around the country. To do that, we will take advantage of <a href="http://infinispan.org/docs/stable/user_guide/user_guide.html#query.continuous">Infinispan&#8217;s Continuous Query</a> functionality which allows us to find those station boards which contain stops that are delayed, and as new delayed trains appeared these will be pushed to our dashboard.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>To run this demo, keep the same servers running as above and do the following:</p> </div> <div class="olist arabic"> <ol class="arabic"> <li> <p>Run <strong>delays.query.continuous.FxApp</strong> application located in real-time project inside the datagrid-patterns demo. This app will inject some live station board data and will launch a JavaFX dashboard that shows delayed trains as they appear. It should look something like this:</p> </li> </ol> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p><a href="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-vyFHhzmswQg/WOdJ1PnoOJI/AAAAAAAAE2A/Ui1YS1T93JIxPKpwbS6u0p1whsok3nxfwCLcB/s1600/Screen%2BShot%2B2017-04-07%2Bat%2B10.11.40.png"><span class="image"><img src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-vyFHhzmswQg/WOdJ1PnoOJI/AAAAAAAAE2A/Ui1YS1T93JIxPKpwbS6u0p1whsok3nxfwCLcB/s320/Screen%2BShot%2B2017-04-07%2Bat%2B10.11.40.png" alt="image" width="320" height="248"></span></a></p> </div> </div> <div class="sect2"> <h3 id="_conclusion"><a class="anchor" href="#_conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h3> <div class="paragraph"> <p>This has been a summary of the demos that we run in our talk at Devoxx France with the intention of getting you running these demos as quickly as possible.

It was a blast to give the talk and although there was a small hiccup with one of the demos, I managed to fix it and the both demos were successfully delivered. The code from the demos can be found in <a href="https://github.com/galderz/distributed-streams">this git repository</a>, and the slides can be found <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/galderz/distributed-java-streams-with-infinispan">here</a>.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>I presented at GeeCON back in 2011 and it was great to be back once again! The organizers keep doing an amazing job and can&#8217;t wait to come back. I particularly enjoyed how GeeCON was embracing other programming languages outside the Java Virtual Machine. For example, there were talks on Julia and Elm programming languages, both of which were superb and I really enjoyed them :).</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>As always I could not attend all the talks I wanted to but heard good things about Tomer&#8217;s "How Shit Works: Storage" and Martin Thompson&#8217;s final "Top 10 Performance Mistakes" keynote. I hope to catch those when the videos are released.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>Hope to come back to GeeCON next year! :)</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>Cheers, Galder</p> </div> </div> </div> </div> <hr> <div class="post"></div> <h3> Thursday, 21 March 2013 </h3> <h1> <a href="/blog/2013/03/21/infinispan-codemotion-rome/">Infinispan @ Codemotion Rome</a> </h1> <div class="content"> <div id="preamble"> <div class="sectionbody"> <div class="paragraph"> <p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-wRMM_KeX1bk/UUs1LxsjvUI/AAAAAAAAKS8/r7cZBGh3rxE/s1600/codemotion.jpeg"><span class="image"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-wRMM_KeX1bk/UUs1LxsjvUI/AAAAAAAAKS8/r7cZBGh3rxE/s200/codemotion.jpeg" alt="image" width="200" height="200"></span></a>Hi,</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>I you happen to be around at this year&#8217;s¬†<a href="http://rome.codemotionworld.com/">Codemotion</a>¬†in Rome and want to know more about Infinispan, or simply want to discuss data-grid related use cases, come and attend my talk <a href="http://rome.codemotionworld.com/talk-page/?talk_name=infinispan-the-open-source-data-grid-platform">"Infinispan the open source data grid platform"</a>.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>Cheers, Mircea</p> </div> </div> </div> </div> <hr> <div class="post"></div> <h3> Monday, 26 March 2012 </h3> <h1> <a href="/blog/2012/03/26/back-from-codemotionit/">Back from Codemotion.it</a> </h1> <div class="content"> <div id="preamble"> <div class="sectionbody"> <div class="paragraph"> <p>I&#8217;ve just returned from <a href="http://www.codemotion.it/">Codemotion Rome</a> where I delivered a talk on Infinispan.
