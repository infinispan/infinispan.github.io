In fact the <a href="https://issues.jboss.org/browse/ISPN-4222">first iteration</a> wasn&#8217;t until Infinispan 7. Then in Infinispan 8, with the addition of Java 8, we fully integrated this into <a href="http://blog.infinispan.org/2015/09/distributed-streams.html">distributed streams</a>, which brought some minor iteration improvements in performance.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>We are proud to announce that with Infinispan 9.2 there are even more improvements. This contains no API changes, although those will surely come in the future. This one is purely for performance and utilization.</p> </div> </div> </div> <div class="sect1"> <h2 id="_new_implementation_details"><a class="anchor" href="#_new_implementation_details"></a>New implementation details</h2> <div class="sectionbody"> <div class="sect2"> <h3 id=""><a class="anchor" href="#"></a> </h3> <div class="paragraph"> <p>There are a few different aspects that have been changed.  A lot of these revolve around the amount of entries being retrieved at once, which if you are familiar with DistributedStreams can be configured via the <a href="https://docs.jboss.org/infinispan/9.2/apidocs/org/infinispan/BaseCacheStream.html#distributedBatchSize-int-">distributedBatchSize</a> method. Note that if this is not specified it defaults to the <a href="https://docs.jboss.org/infinispan/9.2/apidocs/org/infinispan/configuration/cache/StateTransferConfigurationBuilder.html#chunkSize-int-">chunk size</a> in state transfer.</p> </div> <div class="sect3"> <h4 id="_entry_retrieval_is_now_pull_based_instead_of_push"><a class="anchor" href="#_entry_retrieval_is_now_pull_based_instead_of_push"></a>Entry retrieval is now pull based instead of push</h4> <div class="paragraph"> <p>Infinispan core (embedded) has added <a href="https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava/tree/2.x">rxjava2</a> and <a href="https://github.com/reactive-streams/reactive-streams-jvm">reactive streams</a> as dependencies and rewrote all of the old push style iterator code over to pull style to fully utilize the Publisher and Subscriber interfaces.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>With this we only pull up to the batchSize in entries at a time from any set of nodes. The old style utilized push with call stack blocking, which could return up two times the amount of entries. Also since we aren&#8217;t performing call stack blocking, we don&#8217;t have to waste threads as these calls to retrieve entries are done async and finish very quickly irrespective of user interaction. The old method required multiple threads to be reserved for this purpose.</p> </div> </div> <div class="sect3"> <h4 id="_streamed_batches"><a class="anchor" href="#_streamed_batches"></a>Streamed batches</h4> <div class="paragraph"> <p>The responses from a remote node are written directly to the output stream so there are no intermediate collections allocated. This means we only have to iterate upon the data once as we retain the iterator between requests. On the originator we still have to store the batches in a collection to be enqueued for the user to pull.</p> </div> </div> <div class="sect3"> <h4 id="_rewritten_parallel_distribution"><a class="anchor" href="#_rewritten_parallel_distribution"></a>Rewritten Parallel Distribution</h4> <div class="paragraph"> <p>Great care was taken to implement parallel distribution in a way to vastly reduce contention and ensure that we properly follow the batchSize configuration.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>When parallel distribution is in use the new implementation will start 4 remote node requests sharing the batch size (so each one gets 1/4). This way we can guarantee that we only have the desired size irrespective of the number of nodes in the cluster. The old implementation would request batchSize from all nodes at the same time. So not only did it reserve a thread for node but could easily swamp your JVM memory, causing OutOfMemoryErrors (which no one likes). The latter alone made us force the default to be sequential distribution when using an iterator.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>The old implementation would write entries from all nodes (including local) to the same shared queue. The new implementation has a different queue for each request, which allows for faster queues with no locking to be used.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>Due to these changes and other isolations between threads, we can now make parallel distribution the default setting for the iterator method. And as you will see this has improved performance nicely.</p> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div class="sect1"> <h2 id="_performance"><a class="anchor" href="#_performance"></a>Performance</h2> <div class="sectionbody"> <div class="paragraph"> <p>We have written a <a href="http://openjdk.java.net/projects/code-tools/jmh/">JMH</a> test harness specifically for this blog post, testing 9.1.5.Final <a href="https://github.com/infinispan/infinispan/releases/tag/9.1.5.Final">build</a> against latest 9.2.0.SNAPSHOT. The test runs by default with 4GB of heap with 6 nodes in a distributed cache with 2 owners. It has varying entry count, entry sizes and distributed batch sizes.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>Due to the variance in each test a large number of tests were ran and with different permutations to make sure it covered a large amount of test cases. The JMH test that was ran can be found at <a href="https://github.com/infinispan/infinispan-benchmarks/tree/master/iteration">github</a>. All the default settings were used for the run except -t4 (runs with 4 worker threads) was provided. This was all ran on my measly laptop (i7-4810MQ and 16 GB) - maxing out the CPU was not a hard task.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p><strong>CAVEAT</strong>: The tests don&#8217;t do anything with the iterator and just try to pull them as fast as they can. Obviously if you have a lot of processing done between iterations you will likely not see as good of a performance increase.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>The entire results can be found <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18v8e6vG-4aX8Pk-ihB3p1H5cQvsSQlFMhQSKxPhSLf0/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>. It shows each permutation and how many operations per second and finds the difference (green shows 5% or more and red shows -5% or less).</p> </div> <table class="tableblock frame-all grid-all stretch"> <colgroup> <col style="width: 33.3333%;"> <col style="width: 33.3333%;"> <col style="width: 33.3334%;"> </colgroup> <thead> <tr> <th class="tableblock halign-left valign-top">Operation</th> <th class="tableblock halign-left valign-top">Average Gain</th> <th class="tableblock halign-left valign-top">Code</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td class="tableblock halign-left valign-top"><p class="tableblock">Specified Distribution Mode</p></td> <td class="tableblock halign-left valign-top"><p class="tableblock">3.5%</p></td> <td class="tableblock halign-left valign-top"><p class="tableblock">.entrySet().stream().sequentialDistribution.iterator()</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="tableblock halign-left valign-top"><p class="tableblock">Default</p></td> <td class="tableblock halign-left valign-top"><p class="tableblock">11%</p></td> <td class="tableblock halign-left valign-top"><p class="tableblock">.entrySet().iterator()</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="tableblock halign-left valign-top"><p class="tableblock">No Rehash</p></td> <td class="tableblock halign-left valign-top"><p class="tableblock">14%</p></td> <td class="tableblock halign-left valign-top"><p class="tableblock">.entrySet().stream().disableRehashAware().iterator()</p></td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <div class="paragraph"> <p>The above 3 rows show a few different ways you could have been invoking the iterator method. The second row is probably by far the most used case. In this case you should see around a <strong>11</strong>% increase in performance (results will vary). This is due to the new pulling method as well as parallel distribution becoming the new default running mode. It is unlikely a user was using the other 2 methods, but are provided for a more complete view.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>If you were specifying a distribution mode manually, either sequential or distribution you will only see a few percent faster run (<strong>3.5</strong>%), but every little bit helps! Also if you can switch to parallel you may want to think about doing so.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>Also you can see if you were running with rehash disabled prior, it has even more gains (<strong>14</strong>%). Those don&#8217;t even include the fact that no rehash was <strong>28</strong>% faster than with before (which means it is about <strong>32</strong>% faster in general now). So if you can get away with a <em>at most once</em> guarantee, disabling rehash will provide the best throughput.</p> </div> </div> </div> <div class="sect1"> <h2 id="_whats_next"><a class="anchor" href="#_whats_next"></a>Whats next? </h2> <div class="sectionbody"> <div class="paragraph"> <p>As was mentioned this is not exposed to the user directly. You still interact with the iterator as you would normally. We should remedy this at some point.</p> </div> <div class="sect2"> <h3 id="_expose_new_method"><a class="anchor" href="#_expose_new_method"></a>Expose new method</h3> <div class="paragraph"> <p>We would love to eventually expose a method to return a Publisher directly to the user so that they can get the full benefits of having a pull based implementation underneath.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>This way any intermediate operations applied to the stream before would be distributed and anything applied to the Publisher would be done locally. And just like the iterator method this publisher would be fully rehash aware if you have it configured to do so and would make sure you get all entries delivered in an <em>exactly once</em> fashion (rehash disabled guarantees <em>at most once</em>).</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>Another side benefit is that the Subscriber methods could be called on different threads so there is no overhead required on the ISPN side for coordinating these into queue(s). Thus the Subscriber <em>should</em> be able to retrieve all entries faster than just doing an iterator.</p> </div> </div> <div class="sect2"> <h3 id="_java_9_flow"><a class="anchor" href="#_java_9_flow"></a>Java 9 Flow</h3> <div class="paragraph"> <p>Also many of you may be wondering why we aren&#8217;t using the new Flow API introduced in Java 9. Luckily the Flow API is a 1:1 conversion of reactive streams. So whenever Infinispan will start supporting Java 9 interfaces/classes, we hope to properly expose these as the JDK classes.</p> </div> </div> <div class="sect2"> <h3 id="_segment_based_iteration"><a class="anchor" href="#_segment_based_iteration"></a>Segment Based Iteration </h3> <div class="paragraph"> <p>With Infinispan 9.3, we hope to introduce <a href="https://issues.jboss.org/browse/ISPN-5451">data container</a> and <a href="https://issues.jboss.org/browse/ISPN-6026">cache store</a> segment aware iteration. This means when iterating over either we would only have to process entries that map to a given segment. This should reduce the time and processing for iteration substantially, especially for cache stores. Keep your eyes out for a future blog post detailing these as 9.3 development commences.</p> </div> </div> <div class="sect2"> <h3 id="_give_us_feedback"><a class="anchor" href="#_give_us_feedback"></a>Give us Feedback</h3> <div class="paragraph"> <p>We hope you find a bit more performance when working with your distributed iteration.

I&#8217;ve decided to write this article to discuss the main differences from a high level. For deeper technical details, please visit the <a href="http://www.jboss.org/community/wiki/Infinispan">Infinispan wiki</a>.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>Scalability versus high availability These two concepts are often at odds with one another, even though they are commonly lumped together. What is usually good for scalability isn&#8217;t always good for high availability, and vice versa. When it comes to clustering servers, high availability often means simply maintaining more copies, so that if nodes fail - and with commodity hardware, this is expected - state is not lost. An extreme case of this is replicated mode, available in both JBoss Cache and Infinispan, where each node is a clone of its neighbour. This provides very high availability, but unfortunately, this does not scale well. Assume you have 2GB per node. Discounting overhead, with replicated mode, you can only address 2GB of space, regardless of how large the cluster is. Even if you had 100 nodes - seemingly 200GB of space! - you&#8217;d still only be able to address 2GB since each node maintains a redundant copy. Further, since every node needs a copy, a lot of network traffic is generated as the cluster size grows.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>Enter Buddy Replication Buddy Replication (BR) was originally devised as a solution to this scalability problem. BR does not replicate state to every other node in the cluster. Instead, it chooses a fixed number of 'backup' nodes and only replicates to these backups. The number of backups is configurable, but in general it means that the number of backups is fixed. BR improved scalability significantly and showed near-linear scalability with increasing cluster size. This means that as more nodes are added to a cluster, the space available grows linearly as does the available computing power if measured in transactions per second.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>But Buddy Replication doesn&#8217;t help everybody! BR was specifically designed around the HTTP session caching use-case for the JBoss Application Server, and heavily optimised accordingly. As a result, session affinity is mandated, and applications that do not use session affinity can be prone to a lot of data gravitation and 'thrashing' - data is moved back and forth across a cluster as different nodes attempt to claim 'ownership' of state. Of course this is not a problem with JBoss AS and HTTP session caching - session affinity is recommended, available on most load balancer hardware and/or software, is taken for granted, and is a well-understood and employed paradigm for web-based applications.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>So we had to get better Just solving the HTTP session caching use-case wasn&#8217;t enough. A well-performing data grid needs to to better, and crucially, session affinity cannot be taken for granted. And this was the primary reason for not porting BR to Infinispan. As such, Infinispan does not and will not support BR as it is too restrictive.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>Distribution Distribution is a new cache mode in Infinispan. It is also the default clustered mode - as opposed to replication, which isn&#8217;t scalable. Distribution makes use of familiar concepts in data grids, such as <a href="http://www.spiteful.com/2008/03/17/programmers-toolbox-part-3-consistent-hashing/">consistent hashing</a>, call proxying and local caching of remote lookups. What this leads to is a design that does scale well - fixed number of replicas for each cache entry, just like BR - but no requirement for session affinity.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>What about co-locating state? Co-location of state - moving entries about as a single block - was automatic and implicit with BR. Since each node always picked a backup node for all its state, one could visualize all of the state on a given node as a single block. Thus, colocation was trivial and automatic: whatever you put in Node1 will always be together, even if Node1 eventually dies and the state is accessed on Node2. However, this meant that state cannot be evenly balanced across a cluster since the data blocks are very coarse grained. With distribution, colocation is not implicit. In part due to the use of consistent hashing to determine where each cached entry resides, and also in part due to the finer-grained cache structure of Infinispan - key/value pairs instead of a tree-structure - this leads to individual entries as the granularity of state blocks. This means nodes can be far better balanced across a cluster. However, it does mean that certain optimizations which rely on co-location - such as keeping related entries close together - is a little more tricky.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>One approach to co-locate state would be to use containers as values. For example, put all entries that should be colocated together into a HashMap. Then store the HashMap in the cache. But that is coarse-grained and ugly as an approach, and will mean that the entire HashMap would need to be locked and serialized as a single atomic unit, which can be expensive if this map is large.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>Another approach is to use Infinispan&#8217;s <a href="http://infinispan.sourceforge.net/4.0/apidocs/org/infinispan/atomic/AtomicMap.html">AtomicMap</a> API. This powerful API lets you group entries together, so they will always be colocated, locked together, but replication will be much finer-grained, allowing only deltas to the map to be replicated. So that makes replication fast and performant, but it still means everything is locked as a single atomic unit. While this is necessary for certain applications, it isn&#8217;t always be desirable.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>One more solution is to implement your own <a href="http://infinispan.sourceforge.net/4.0/apidocs/org/infinispan/distribution/ConsistentHash.html">ConsistentHash</a> algorithm - perhaps extending DefaultConsistentHash. This implementation would have knowledge of your object model, and hashes related instances such that they are located together in the hash space. By far the most complex mechanism, but if performance and co-location really is a hard requirement then you cannot get better than this approach.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>In summary:</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>Buddy Replication</p> </div> <div class="ulist"> <ul> <li> <p>Near-linear scalability</p> </li> <li> <p>Session affinity mandatory</p> </li> <li> <p>Co-location automatic</p> </li> <li> <p>Applicable to a specific set of use cases due to the session affinity requirement</p> </li> </ul> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>Distribution</p> </div> <div class="ulist"> <ul> <li> <p>Near-linear scalability</p> </li> <li> <p>No session affinity needed</p> </li> <li> <p>Co-location requires special treatment, ranging in complexity based on performance and locking requirements.
