We're in a period of frequent release candidates now, getting Infinispan
5.0 ever closer to a final release.  Thanks to everyone who provided
excellent feedback on last week's CR2.

This week's release candidate - CR3 - fixes a number of reported bugs
including https://issues.jboss.org/browse/ISPN-1049[ISPN-1049],
https://issues.jboss.org/browse/ISPN-965[ISPN-965] and
https://issues.jboss.org/browse/ISPN-977[ISPN-977] and others
(https://issues.jboss.org/secure/ConfigureReport.jspa?atl_token=AQZJ-FV3A-N91S-UDEU%7C65aee2eedcb75cb0f1eda240bb0e292e324dacbd%7Clin&versions=12316437&sections=all&style=none&selectedProjectId=12310799&reportKey=org.jboss.labs.jira.plugin.release-notes-report-plugin%3Areleasenotes&Next=Next[full
ChangeLog in JIRA]).  Better documentation on the
http://community.jboss.org/wiki/ConfiguringCacheProgrammatically#Fluent_Programmatic_Configuration_new_in_Infinispan_50[new
fluent configuration], a wiki page on
http://community.jboss.org/wiki/Per-InvocationFlags[advanced Flag
usage] thanks to Galder, as well as
https://issues.jboss.org/browse/ISPN-1125[better log messages] to help
you size tables in an RDBMS when using the JDBC CacheStore thanks to
Sanne also made it in this timeframe.

And finally, a few new things -
https://issues.jboss.org/browse/ISPN-360[new notifications] to inform
you of when rehashes start and end, and a new, experimental
https://issues.jboss.org/browse/ISPN-312[grouping API] to give you
control over where entries are stored in a distributed cluster, enabling
you to specify which entries get colocated together.
 http://in.relation.to/user/pete[Pete Muir] - of
http://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=299[CDI] and
http://seamframework.org/[Seam] fame - contributed this patch, we'd love
your feedback on it.

As per usual, http://www.jboss.org/infinispan/downloads[downloads] are

provide feedback and report any issues.
