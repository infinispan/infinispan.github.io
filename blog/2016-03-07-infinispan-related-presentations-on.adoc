DevConf.cz (Developer Conference) is a free annual conference for all
Linux and JBoss Community Developers, Admins and Linux users organized
by Red Hat Czech Republic in cooperation with the Fedora and JBoss
communities. See more details on http://devconf.cz/[DevConf's
homepage].

Since it's JBoss related conference, Infinispan cannot be missing there!
We had two Infinispan related presentantions. First of them was
presented by Jiří Holuša focusing on new features in Infinispan 8. The
presentation also covers very gentle introduction to Infinispan in
general.

The second one, named "From Big Data towards Fast Data",  was given by
Vojtěch Juránek and talked about latest trends in Big Data world. The
presentation goes through the introduction about Big Data, mentions the
problems with it and comes up with the term Fast Data. Some approaches
are presented, how to solve this Fast Data phenomenon, ending up with
new Infinispan Spark connector as one of the possible solutions.

Please, see the links below.
