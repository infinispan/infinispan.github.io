Dear Infinispan community,




We're pleased to announce the final release of Infinispan 6.0
"Infinium". As
http://infinispan.blogspot.co.uk/2013/05/infinispan-to-adopt-apache-software.html[announced],
this is the first Infinispan stable version to be released under the
terms of http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html[Apache License
v2.0].




This release brings some highly demanded features besides many stability
enhancements and bug fixes:




* Support for
http://blog.infinispan.org/2013/09/embedded-and-remote-query-in-infinispan.html[remote
query]. It is now possible for the HotRod clients to query an Infinispan
grid using a new expressive query DSL. This querying functionality is
built on top of Apache Lucene and Google Protobuf and lays the
foundation for storing information and querying an Infinispan server in
a language neutral manner. The Java HotRod client has already been
enhanced to support this, the soon-to-be announced C++ HotRod client
will also contain this functionality (initially for write/read, then
full blown querying).
* C++ HotRod client.  Allows C++ applications to read and write
information from an Infinispan server. This is a fully fledged HotRod
client that is topology (level 2) and consistent hash aware (level 3)
and will be released in the following days. Some features (such as
Remote Query and SSL support) will be developed during the next
iteration so that it maintains feature parity with its Java counterpart.
* Better persistence integration. We’ve revisited the entire cache
loader API and we’re quite pleased with the result: the new
http://blog.infinispan.org/2013/09/new-persistence-api-in-infinispan.html[Persistence
API] brought by Infinispan 6.0 supports parallel iteration of the stored
entries, reduces the overall serialization overhead and also is aligned
with the http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=107[JSR-107] specification,
which makes implementations more portable.

* A more efficient FileCacheStore
http://blog.infinispan.org/2013/07/faster-file-cache-store-no-extra.html[implementation].
This file store is built with efficiency in mind: it outperforms the
existing file store with up to 2 levels of magnitude. This comes at a
cost though, as keys need to be kept  in memory. Thanks to
https://github.com/kblees[Karsten Blees] for contributing this!
* Support for
http://blog.infinispan.org/2013/09/heterogenous-clusters-with-infinispan.html[heterogeneous
clusters]. Up to this release, every member of the cluster owns an equal
share of the cluster’s data. This doesn’t work well if one machine is
more powerful than the other cluster participants. This functionality
allows specifying the amount of data, compared with the average, held by
a particular machine.
* A new set of usage and performance
https://issues.jboss.org/browse/ISPN-2861[statistics] developed within
the scope of the CloudTM
projecthttps://issues.jboss.org/browse/ISPN-3234[].
* https://issues.jboss.org/browse/ISPN-3234[JCache] (JSR-107)
implementation upgrade. First released in Infinispan 5.3.0, the standard
caching support is now upgraded to version 1.0.0-PFD.




For a complete list of features included in this release please refer to

notes].

The user documentation for this release has been revamped and migrated
to the http://infinispan.org/documentation/[new website] - we think it
looks much better and hope you’ll like it too!

This release has spread over a period of 5 months: a sustained effort
from the core development team, QE team and our growing community - a
BIG thanks to everybody involved! Please visit our
http://infinispan.org/download/[downloads] section to find the latest
release. Also if you have any questions please check our
