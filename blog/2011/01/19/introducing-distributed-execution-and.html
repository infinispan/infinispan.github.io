<p>In case you did not pay attention to the area of large scale distributed
computing – there is a revolution going on! It is becoming increasingly
evident that the software ecosystems built around so called Big Data are
at the forefront of cloud computing innovation. Unfortunately, there has
been more
<a href="http://openlife.cc/blogs/2011/january/terabytes-not-big-data-petabytes">debate</a>
around determining how big Big Data actually is rather than defining
common set of requirements for the large scale Big Data computational
platforms.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Stephen O&#8217;Grady of RedMonk
<a href="http://redmonk.com/sogrady/2011/01/13/apache-hadoop/">summarized</a> this
phenomena succinctly: “Big Data, like NoSQL, has become a liability in
most contexts. Setting aside the lack of a consistent definition, the
term is of little utility because it is single-dimensional. Larger
dataset sizes present unique computational challenges. But the
structure, workload, accessibility and even location of the data may
prove equally challenging.”</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Zack Urlocker, an advisor and board member to several startup companies
in the area of SaaS was equally vocal in his
<a href="http://www.theopenforce.com/2010/09/do-we-programming-language-big-data.html">criticism</a>
regarding complexity of the existing systems : “You pretty much gotta be
near genius level to build systems on top of Cassandra, Hadoop and the
like today. These are powerful tools, but very low-level, equivalent to
programming client server applications in assembly language. When it
works its [<em>sic</em>] great, but the effort is significant and it’s probably
beyond the scope of mainstream IT organizations.”</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is exactly where we are positioning Infinispan&#8217;s roadmap as we are
announcing initial steps into the area of distributed execution and
MapReduce framework built on top of Infinispan. Infinispan&#8217;s distributed
data grid is a most natural fit for such a platform. We have already
built an infrastructure for essentially unlimited linear in-memory data
scaling. However, having such a data grid without an ability to execute
large scale computation on it is like having a Ferrari without a drivers
licence. Listening to the criticism regarding the lack of direction in
Big Data field and complexity of the existing distributed execution
frameworks our focus was primarily on simplicity without sacrificing
power and a rich feature set such a framework should have.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="simplemodel">Simple distributed execution model</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The main interfaces for simple distributed task execution are
<a href="https://github.com/infinispan/infinispan/blob/master/core/src/main/java/org/infinispan/distexec/DistributedCallable.java">DistributedCallable</a>
and
<a href="https://github.com/infinispan/infinispan/blob/master/core/src/main/java/org/infinispan/distexec/DistributedExecutorService.java">DistributedExecutorService</a>.
DistributedCallable is essentially a version of the existing Callable
from java.util.concurrent package except that DistributedCallable can be
executed in remote JVM and receive input from Infinispan cache. Tasks'
main algorithm is essentially unchanged, only the input source is
changed. Exisiting Callable implementation most likely gets its input in
a form of some Java object/primitive while DistributedCallable gets its
input from Infinispan cache. Therefore, users who have already
implemented Callable interface to describe their task units would simply
extend DistributedCallable and use keys from Infinispan execution
environment as input for the task. Implentation of DistributedCallable
can in fact continue to support implementation of an already existing
Callable while simultaneously be ready for distribited execution by
extending DistributedCallable.</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code>public interface DistributedCallable extends Callable {
/**
* Invoked by execution environment after DistributedCallable
* has been migrated for execution to
* a specific Infinispan node.
*
* @param cache
*           cache whose keys are used as input data for
* this DistributedCallable task
* @param inputKeys
*           keys used as input for this DistributedCallable task
*/
public void setEnvironment(Cache cache, Set inputKeys);
}</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>DistributedExecutorService is an simple extension of a familiar
ExecutorService from java.util.concurrent package. However, the
advantages of DistributedExecutorService are not to be overlooked. For
the existing Callable tasks users would submit to ExecutorService there
is an option to submit them for an execution on Infinispan cluster.
Infinispan execution environment would migrate this task to an execution
node, run the task and return the results to the calling node. Of
course, not all Callable task would benefit from this feature. Excellent
candidates are long running and computationally intensive tasks.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The second advantage of the DistributedExecutorService is that it allows
a quick and simple implementation of tasks that take input from
Infinispan cache nodes, execute certain computation and return results
to the caller. Users would specify which keys to use as input for
specified DistributedCallable and submit that callable for execution on
Infinispan cluster. Infinispan runtime would locate the appriate keys,
migrate DistributedCallable to target execution node(s) and finally
return a list of results for each executed Callable. Of course, users
can omit specifying input keys in which case Infinispan would execute
DistributedCallable on all keys for a specified cache.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="MapReduce_model">MapReduce model</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Infinispan&#8217;s own MapReduce model is an adaptation of Google&#8217;s original
MapReduce. There are four main components in each map reduce task:
Mapper, Reducer, Collator and MapReduceTask.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><span class="cm">Implementation of a Mapper class is a component of a MapReduceTask
invoked once for each input entry K,V. Every Mapper instance migrated to
an Infinispan node, given a cache entry K,V input pair transforms that
input pair into a result T. Intermediate result T is further reduced
using a Reducer.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code>public interface Mapper {

/**
* Invoked once for each input cache entry
* K,V transforms that input into a result T.
*
* @param key
*           the kay
* @param value
*           the value
* @return result T
*/
T map(K key, V value);

}</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><span class="cm">Reducer, as its name implies, reduces a list of results T from map
phase of MapReduceTask. Infinispan distributed execution environment
creates one instance of Reducer per execution node.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code>public interface Reducer {


/**
* Reduces a result T from map phase and return R.
* Assume that on Infinispan node N, an instance
* of Mapper was mapped and invoked on k many
* key/value pairs. Each T(i) in the list of all
* T's returned from map phase executed on
* Infinispan node N is passed to reducer along
* with previsouly computed R(i-1). Finally the last
* invocation of reducer on T(k), R is returned to a
* distributed task that originated map/reduce
* request.
*
* @param mapResult
*           result T of map phase
* @param previouslyReduced
*           previously accumulated reduced result
* @return result R
*
*/
R reduce(T mapResult, R previouslyReduced);

}</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><span class="cm">Collator coordinates results from Reducers executed on Infinispan
cluster and assembles a final result returned to an invoker of
MapReduceTask. #[.cm]</span> #</p>

void reducedResultReceived(Address remoteNode, R remoteResult);

<div class="paragraph">
<p>[.cm]#Finally,
<a href="https://github.com/infinispan/infinispan/blob/master/core/src/main/java/org/infinispan/distexec/mapreduce/MapReduceTask.java">MapReduceTask</a>
is a distributed task uniting Mapper, Reducer and Collator into a
cohesive large scale computation to be transparently parallelized across
Infinispan cluster nodes. Users of MapReduceTask need to provide a cache
whose data is used as input for this task. Infinispan execution
environment will instantiate and migrate instances of provided mappers
and reducers seamlessly across Infinispan nodes. Unless otherwise
specified using onKeys method input keys filter all available key value
pairs of a specified cache will be used as input data for this task. #</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>[.cm]#MapReduceTask implements a slightly different execution model from
the original MapReduce proposed by Google. Here is the pseudocode of the
MapReduceTask.
#</p>

<div class="listingblock">

return r to Infinispan node that invoked the task

On Infinispan node invoking this task:
reduced_results = invoke map reduce task on all nodes, retrieve map{address:result}
for r in reduced_results.entries:
remote_address = r.key

<div class="paragraph">
<p>In order to get a better feel for MapReduce framework lets have a look
at the example related to Infinispan&#8217;s grid file system. How would we
calculate total size of all files in the system using MapReduce
framework? Easy! Have a look at GridFileSizeExample.</p>

return (long) value.getLength();

@Override
public Long reduce(Long mapResult, Long previouslyReduced) {
return previouslyReduced == null ? mapResult : mapResult + previouslyReduced;

private Long result = 0L;

@Override

<p>In conclusion, this is not a perfect and final distributed execution and
MapReduce API that can satisfy requirements of all users but it is a
good start. As we push forward and make it more feature rich while
keeping it simple we are continuously looking for your feedback.
Together we can reach the ambitious goals set out in the beginning of
this article.</p>
