As mentioned by Mircea in the
http://infinispan.blogspot.com.es/2013/05/infinispan-530beta2-is-out.html[Infinispan
5.3.0.Beta2 release blog post], interoperability between embedded
Infinispan and remote Infinispan modes, including Hot Rod, Memcached and
REST is now here!

What this means is that you should be able to store data via one of the
endpoints and retrieve data from a different one. So, I can store an
Java object using the Java Hot Rod client, and I can retrieve it using
the embedded interface.

Documentation for this new interoperability, or compatibility mode, can
be found https://docs.jboss.org/author/x/kYH2Aw[here], including the key
aspects of this new functionality, configuration and links to some
examples.

As we head towards the later part of the Infinispan 5.3 series, if
you're interested in accessing data in multiple ways, give it a go and
let us know what you think!

Cheers,
Galder
