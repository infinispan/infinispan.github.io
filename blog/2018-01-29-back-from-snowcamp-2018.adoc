This week, I'm recovering from the https://snowcamp.io/[Snowcamp 2018]
conference in Grenoble. I had an amazing time there, where I could
hang-out with people from the french community, discussing tech, coding,
non-blocking APIs, lifestyle and diversity!

My talk was on Thursday at 15:00. It was very exciting for me because I
was live-coding in front of so many people for the first time! I got
very valuable feedback from attendees and speakers to improve my
content, live-coding skills and encouragements to submit this talk to
other user groups and conferences this year.

This presentation focuses on the work we have been doing to provide a
new API available in Infinispan 9.2 (final release coming very very
soon!!!):
http://infinispan.org/docs/dev/user_guide/user_guide.html#clustered_lock[Clustered
Locks]. These locks are distributed and non blocking, allowing us to
synchronise protected code between different Infinispan nodes across a
cluster.

It's a 45 minutes talk, so I'm not presenting the API just from the user
point of view; instead I go deep into the actual Clustered Locks
internals. We have built this first implementation on top of existing
Infinispan's APIs, which proves that they can be used to do much more
than just speeding your applications and caching!

The first user of these locks is the
https://github.com/vert-x3/vertx-infinispan[Vert.x-Infinispan Cluster
Manager.] Before going into the implementation details, I show how to
create a cluster of http://vertx.io/[Vert.x] applications using
Infinispan and a simple example of when and how to use a
http://vertx.io/docs/apidocs/io/vertx/core/shareddata/Lock.html[Vert.x
Lock]. Underneath Vert.x Locks, the next release of the cluster manager
will be using the Clustered Locks API. I'm preparing a longer article on
this matter, so stay tuned! Meanwhile, enjoy the presentation slides!
