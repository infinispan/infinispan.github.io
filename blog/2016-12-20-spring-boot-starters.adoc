Ho, ho, hooo! It looks like all members of Infinispan Community have
been nice and Santa brought you Spring Boot Starters!

This will make you even more productive and your code less verbose!



=== Why do I need starters?



Spring Boot Starters make the bootstrapping process much easier and
faster. The starter brings you required Maven dependencies as well as
some predefined configuration bits.



=== What do I need to get started?



The starter can operate in two modes: client/server (when you connect to
a remote Infinispan Server cluster) and embedded (packaged along with
your app). The former is the default. It's also possible to use both
those modes at the same time (store some data along with your app and
connect to a remote Infinispan Server cluster to perform some other type
of operations).



Assuming you have an Infinispan Server running on IP address
192.168.0.17, all you need to do is to use the following dependencies:





By default, the starter will try to locate _hotrod-client.properties_
file. The file should contain at least the server list:





It is also possible to create _RemoteCacheManager_'s configuration
manually:





That's it! Your app should successfully connect to a remote cluster and
you should be able to inject _RemoteCacheManager_.



Using Infinispan embedded is even simpler than that. All you need to do
is to add additional dependency to the classpath:





The starter will provide you a preconfigured _EmbeddedCacheManager_. In
order to customize the configuration, use the following code snippet:

Boot tutorial] and the second is the

=== Kudos



Special thanks go to Marco Yuen, who donated us with Spring Boot
Starters code and Tomasz Zabłocki, who updated them to current version
and Stéphane Nicoll who spent tremendous amount of time reviewing the
Starters.
