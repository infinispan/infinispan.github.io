A lot of people have asked about being able to use Infinispan as a
second level cache for http://www.hibernate.org/[Hibernate] within
http://jboss.org/jbossas/docs/5-x[JBoss AS 5.x] (and its
http://www.jboss.com/products/platforms/application/[EAP 5.x
cousins]).

While Infinispan can be used as a
http://community.jboss.org/wiki/UsingInfinispanasJPAHibernateSecondLevelCacheProvider[Hibernate
second level cache with Hibernate 3.5 onwards], Bill deCoste has written
http://community.jboss.org/wiki/InfinispanasHibernate2nd-LevelCacheinJBossAS5x[a
guide] to getting Infinispan to work in older versions of Hibernate,
specifically with JBoss AS 5.x.  Hope you find this useful!
