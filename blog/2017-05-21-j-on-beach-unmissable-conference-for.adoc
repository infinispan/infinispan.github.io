https://jonthebeach.com/[J On The Beach] was a blast! It's only their
second year doing the conference, but it was really well managed and it
had an amazing lineup of speakers. To top that up, it was in Malaga so
the good weather made it possible to stay outside in the garden at
http://www.latermicamalaga.com/[La Termica] chatting to attendees and
speakers.

The evening before the start of the conference, we had a welcome
reception at the Ayuntamiento de Malaga learning about IT and Big Data
promotion that the major and his team are helping with.

The conference started with a mind-blowing keynote on quantum computing
by https://www.dwavesys.com/our-company/leadership[Eric Ladizinsky]. It
was a super talk with very interesting information about what the future
might hold in terms of computing. The challenges of quantum computing
are immense but the possibilities it opens up staggering as well.

That first morning I had the chance to see https://aphyr.com/about[Kyle
Kingsbury]'s https://github.com/jepsen-io/jepsen[Jepsen] talk which was
very entertaining. He gave an intro on Jepsen and looked back at the
results of different distributed environments. This allowed the audience
to get a good overview on what each system is capable of and what
guarantees they provide. Also in the first day I attended,
http://christophermeiklejohn.com/[Christopher Meiklejohn]'s talk on
http://syncfree.github.io/antidote/[Antidote], a geo-replicated NoSQL
database with strong guarantees based on Riak. It uses CRDTs and Hight
Available Transactions to achieve this.

On the second day I had my presentation on Functional Reactive
Programming with Elm, Node.js and Infinispan. It was well received and
got good feedback. Slides can be found
https://speakerdeck.com/galderz/learn-how-to-build-functional-reactive-applications-with-elm-node-dot-js-and-infinispan-2[here],
and the demo repository is
https://github.com/galderz/infinispan-events/tree/mid17[here].
Unfortunately, due to scheduling and preparations for my talk, I
couldn't go to Duarte Dunes' http://www.scylladb.com/[ScyllaDB] and
Tyler Akidau's https://beam.apache.org/[Apache Beam] talks, but I hope
to catch those up when the videos are shared.

However, I was able to attend https://twitter.com/caitie[Caitie
Mccaffrey]'s talk on
https://speakerdeck.com/caitiem20/distributed-sagas-a-protocol-for-coordinating-microservices[Distributed
Sagas, a protocol for coordinating microservices]. Even though such
protocol would be hard to implement in all situations, e.g. online
ticket shop for a very popular artist, it had some interesting
characteristics. The talk itself was delivered masterfully.

Finally, I was at https://twitter.com/mjpt777[Martin Thompson]'s High
Performance Managed Languages talk which was superb! With years of
experience and the development of Aeron on his back, he was able to give
a interesting overview of the performance characteristics of managed vs
unmanaged languages. Flexibility in managed languages, such as in C#,
seems to be the best way to achieve the best performance.

All in all it was a fantastic conference, and I was delighted to have
been part of it. https://valo.io/[Valo], the company behind J On The
Beach were fantastic hosts and met some amazing people that are or had
been part of this company, including: Luis, Justo, Michael,
Danielle...etc.

I hope to come up another time :)

Cheers,
Galder
