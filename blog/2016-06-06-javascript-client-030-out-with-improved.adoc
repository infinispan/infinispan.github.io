Earlier today Infinispan Javascript client version 0.3.0 was released
whose primary focus has been stabilising and tightening existing
functionality, deprecating some older methods, and documentation:


* Multiple fixes around remote execution, remote listeners and
iteration.
* Improved failover handling logic to correctly deal with socket error
and remote disconnect situations.
* Removed getVersioned, getBulk and getBulkKeys methods since these are
deprecated in favour of getWithMetadata and getAll. The examples in the
README file have been updated.
* Added API documentation for Javascript client. Online API docs for
Javascript client can be found
http://docs.jboss.org/infinispan/hotrod-clients/javascript/1.0/apidocs/module-infinispan.html[here].

If you're a Javascript user and want to store data remotely in
Infinispan Server instances, please give the client a go and tell us
what you think of it via our
https://developer.jboss.org/en/infinispan/content[forum], via our
https://issues.jboss.org/projects/ISPN[issue tracker] or via IRC on the
#infinispan channel on Freenode.



Cheers,

Galder
