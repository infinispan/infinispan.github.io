Since Infinispan 5.2.0, Infinispan
https://issues.jboss.org/browse/ISPN-2290[registers JMX MBeans by
default] even if statistics are disabled. This was done so that
management related operations could be called even if statistics were
disabled.

This change resulted in a small usability problem for those users that
wanted to create a cluster of Infinispan instances on the same JVM. This
is a very common use case when first starting to use Infinispan or when
trying to create some unit tests.

When multiple Infinispan instances run on same JVM, they would all try
to register JMX MBeans but unless you explicitly gave each Infinispan
instance a different CacheManager name, you'd see exceptions like
this:

Caused by: org.infinispan.jmx.JmxDomainConflictException: ISPN000034:
There's already a JMX MBean instance
type=Cache,name="___defaultcache(repl_sync)",manager="DefaultCacheManager"
already registered under 'org.infinispan' JMX domain...

Starting with Infinispan 9.2.0,
https://issues.jboss.org/browse/ISPN-8395[duplicate JMX domains are
allowed by default], so you won't need to fiddle with JMX domain
settings any more to create an Infinispan cluster on the same JVM :)

Cheers,
