= Infinispan 12.0.0.Dev03

Dear Infinispan community,

Infinispan 12 development release 03 is here!

== Cross Site Replication

With the new asynchronous cross-site replication algorithm introduced in Infinispan 11, this release brings
a long desired feature: *conflict resolution*.

It is possible to configure a merge policy where, in case of conflict between updates of different sites, the value
can be merged. Some predefined merge policies can be found 
https://docs.jboss.org/infinispan/12.0/apidocs/org/infinispan/xsite/spi/XSiteMergePolicy.html[here].

See the docs for more https://infinispan.org/docs/dev/titles/xsite/xsite.html#conflict_resolution-xsite[information about conflict resolution].

.Performance improvement
Another small improvement has been made to cross-site replication in this release.
When sites get requests targeting caches that don't exist or aren't started,
sender sites stop retrying the requests, which takes the backup location offline.
Administrators must then bring the sites back online and perform state transfer to sync possible
out-of-date data.

== Infinispan Server

This version includes a new version of the web console, including mainly fixes, but also the ability to filter
between Strong and Weak counters and to remove counters from the list.
