= Infinispan 12.0.0.Dev03

Dear Infinispan community,

The third of our development releases of Infinispan 12 is here!

== Documentation
Our documentation has been updated with some additional content as well as improvements for clarity and
technical accuracy, notably:
* Infinispan Operator Guide
* Server Guide
* Guide to Cross-Site Replication
* Security Guide

As always, the Infinispan team hope you find the documentation useful and complete. We’d love to hear from you and
really value feedback from our community. If you think something is missing from the docs or spot a correction,
please get in touch and we’ll get on it straight away.

== Cross Site Replication
With the new asynchronous cross-site replication algorithm introduced in Infinispan 11, this release brings
a long desired feature: *conflict resolution*.
It is possible to configure a merge policy where, in case of conflict between updates of different sites, the value
can be merged. Some predefined merge policies can be found here.

More information about conflict resolution in [link to docs!]

A small improvement has been made related to invalid caches configuration.
When a site receives a request targeting a specific cache, but the cache doesn’t exist or isn’t started yet,
the sender site will stop retrying changing the site’s status to offline.
It requires admin intervention to bring the site back online and trigger a state transfer to sync possible
out-of-date data.

== Infinispan Server
This version includes a new version of the web console, including mainly fixes, but also the ability to filter
between Strong and Weak counters and to remove counters from the list.
