Infinispan 5.1.0.BETA5 has just been the released with a few interesting
additions and important fixes:

* Locks acquired within a transaction are now reordered in order to
avoid deadlocks. There's no new configuration required to take advantage
of this feature. More information on how lock reordering works can be
found http://community.jboss.org/docs/DOC-16975[here].
* One of the aims of Infinispan 5.1 'Brahma' series is to move away from
JAXB and instead use Stax based XML parsing. Ahead of that, a new
configuration API based on builders has been developed. Expect to hear
more about it and examples on using the API in the next few days.

Amongst the fixes included in this release, it's worth mentioning:

* The demo paths that were broken in 5.1.0.BETA4 have now been fixed.
* Some of the Infinispan jars in 5.1.0.BETA4 were showing duplicate
classes. This was the result of an OSGI bundle generation bug, and so to
avoid the issue 5.1.0.BETA5 OSGI bundle generation has been disabled.
This functionality will be re-enabled once the issue has been fixed by
the Maven Felix plugin.

As always, please keep
