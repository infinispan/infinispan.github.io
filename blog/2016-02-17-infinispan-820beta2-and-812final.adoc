Dear Infinispan community,

we're proud to announce two fresh releases today.
First off is 8.2.0.Beta2, from our development branch. It is packed with
a bunch of goodies:


* lots of enhancements and additions to the administration console for
Infinispan Server, such as cluster event views, task management,
container administration and deployments. Some of these will be further
refined before the upcoming Final release. If you prefer to manage your
servers from the good ol' command-line, the CLI commands have also been
similarly enhanced.
* performance improvements for clustered reads, bulk and stream ops, and
a sensible reduction in memory allocation rate. More improvements will
come as we are rewriting some parts of the core to allow further
optimizations.
* a new distributed executor,
https://docs.jboss.org/infinispan/8.2/apidocs/org/infinispan/manager/ClusterExecutor.html[ClusterExecutor]
which does not require an existing distributed cache and which comes
complete with Java 8 goodness such as CompletableFutures and lambda
support. This nicely complements our existing Streams support.
* a new, experimental index manager to store indexes on Infinispan with
better scalability and indexing throughput. Additionally we've upgraded
Lucene to 5.4.1 and Hibernate Search to 5.6.0.Alpha1
* the ability to indicate a number of nodes for initial cluster
formation
* lots of bug fixes

We're still on track for a Final release at the end of the month.

We've also been fixing bugs in our stable 8.1 stream, which means we
have a freshly released 8.1.2.Final.
