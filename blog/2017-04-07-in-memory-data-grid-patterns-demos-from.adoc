http://devoxx.fr/[Devoxx France 2017] was a blast!! Emmanuel and I would
like to thank all attendees to our
http://cfp.devoxx.fr/2017/talk/UKK-0693/Architecture_par_la_pratique:_patterns_d%E2%80%99utilisation_de_systemes_in-memory_-_WD-40_entre_vos_donnees_et_vos_applis[in-memory
data grids patterns] talk. The room was full and we thoroughly enjoyed
the experience!

During the talk we presented a couple of small demos that showcased some
in-memory data grid use cases. The demos are located
https://github.com/galderz/datagrid-patterns[here], but I thought it'd
be useful to provide some
https://github.com/galderz/datagrid-patterns[step-by-step] here so that
you can get them running as quickly as possible.

Before we start with any of the demos, it's necessary to run some set up
steps:

  1. Check out git repository:

    git clone https://github.com/galderz/datagrid-patterns

  2. Download
http://downloads.jboss.org/infinispan/9.0.0.Final/infinispan-server-9.0.0.Final-bin.zip[Infinispan
Server 9.0.0.Final] and at the same level as the git repository.

  3. Go into the datagrid-patterns directory, start the servers and wait
until they've started:

    cd datagrid-patterns
    ./run-servers.sh

  4. Install https://www.continuum.io/downloads[Anaconda for Python 3],
this is required to run Jupyter notebook for plotting.

  5. Install https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi[Maven 3].

Once the set up is complete, it's time to start with the individual
demos.

Both demos shown below work with the same application domain: rail
transport systems. In this domain, we differentiate between physical
stations, trains, station boards which are located in stations, and
finally stops, which are individual entries in station boards.


=== Analytics Demo


The first demo is focused on how you can use Infinispan for doing
offline analytics. In particular, this demo tries to answer the
following question:

_Q. What is the time of the day when there is the biggest ratio of
delayed trains?_



To answer this question, Infinispan data grid will be loaded with 3
weeks worth of data from station boards. Once the data is loaded, we
will execute a remote server task which will use
http://infinispan.org/docs/stable/user_guide/user_guide.html#streams[Infinispan
Distributed Java Streams] to calculate the two pieces of information
required to answer the question: per hour, how many trains are going
through the system, and out of those, how many are delayed.



An important aspect to bear in mind about this server tasks is that it
will only be executed in one of the nodes in the cluster. It does not
matter which one. In turn, this node will will ship the lambdas required
to do the computation to each of the nodes so that they can executed
against their local data. The other nodes will reply with the results
and the node where the server task was invoked will aggregate the
results.



Then, these results are sent back to the client, which in turn, stores
the results as JSON in an intermediate cache. Once the results are in
place, we will use a Jupyter notebook to read those results and plot the
result.



Let's see these steps in action:



  1. First, we need to install the server tasks in the running servers
above:



    cd datagrid-patterns/analytics

    mvn clean install package -am -pl analytics-server

    mvn wildfly:deploy -pl analytics-server

    

  2. Open the datagrid-pattern repo with your favourite IDE and run
*delays.java.stream.InjectApp* class located in
analytics/analytics-server project. This command will inject the data
into the cache. On my environment, it takes between 1 and 2 minutes.



  3. With the data loaded, we need to run the remote task that will
calculate the total number of trains per hour and how many of those are
delayed. To do that, execute *delays.java.stream.AnalyticsApp* class
located in analytics/analytics-server project from your IDE.



  4. You can verify that the results have been calculating by going to
the following address:



    http://localhost:8180/rest/analytics-results/results



  5. With the results in place, it's time to start the Jupyter notebook:



    cd datagrid-patterns/analytics/analytics-jupyter

    ~/anaconda/bin/jupyter notebook



  6. Once the notebook opens, click open *live-demo.ipynb* notebook and
execute each of the cells in order. You should end up seeing a plot like
this:

So, the answer to the question:



_Q. What is the time of the day when there is the biggest ratio of
delayed trains?_



is *2am*! That's because last connecting trains of the day wait for each
other to avoid leaving passengers stranded.



=== Real Time Demo



The second demo that we presented uses the same application domain as
above, but this time we're trying to use our data grid as a way of
storing the station board state of each station at a given point in
time. So, the idea is to use Infinispan as an in memory data grids for
working with real time data.



So, what can we do with this type of data? In our demo, we will create a
centralised dashboard of delayed trains around the country. To do that,
we will take advantage of
http://infinispan.org/docs/stable/user_guide/user_guide.html#query.continuous[Infinispan's
Continuous Query] functionality which allows us to find those station
boards which contain stops that are delayed, and as new delayed trains
appeared these will be pushed to our dashboard.



To run this demo, keep the same servers running as above and do the
following:



1. Run *delays.query.continuous.FxApp* application located in real-time
project inside the datagrid-patterns demo. This app will inject some
live station board data and will launch a JavaFX dashboard that shows
delayed trains as they appear. It should look something like this:

=== Conclusion

This has been a summary of the demos that we run in our talk at Devoxx
France with the intention of getting you running these demos as quickly
as possible. The repository contains more detailed information of these
demos. If there's anything unclear or any of the instructions above are
not working, please let us know!



Thanks to Emmanuel Bernard for partnering with me for this Devoxx France
talk and for the continuous feedback while developing the demos. Thanks
as well to Tristan Tarrant for the input in the demos and many thanks to
all Devoxx France attendees who attended our talk :)



A very special thanks to *Alexandre Masselot* whose
https://www.slideshare.net/alexmass/swiss-transport-in-real-time-tribulations-in-the-big-data-stack["Swiss
Transport in Real Time: Tribulations in the Big] Data Stack" talk at
Soft-Shake 2016 was the inspiration for these demos. @Alex, thanks a lot
for sharing the demos and data with me and the rest of the community!!



In a just a few weeks I'll be at
http://www.developermarch.com/developersummit/[Great Indian Developer
Summit] presenting these demos and much more! Stay tuned :)



Cheers,

Galder
