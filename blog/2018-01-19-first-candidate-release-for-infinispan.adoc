Infinispan 9.2.0.CR1 is out! The Infinispan team took time off over the
festive period but in spite of that we managed to pack in quite a bit as
we approach Infinispan 9.2.0 final release.

Here are the highlights:


* Remove listener in embedded only fired when something is actually
removed - https://issues.jboss.org/browse/ISPN-8585[ISPN-8585].
* CacheNotFoundException ERROR message in server was deemed too noisy,
so it was changed to DEBUG message. If RemoteCacheManager.getCache()
returns null, the cache does not exist -
https://issues.jboss.org/browse/ISPN-8579[ISPN-8579].
* Infinispan is now compatible with JCache 1.1 -
https://issues.jboss.org/browse/ISPN-8571[ISPN-8571].
* Hibernate 5.2 compatible Infinispan cache provider (on top of
Hibernate 5.1 compatible provider) -
https://issues.jboss.org/browse/ISPN-8570[ISPN-8570].
* http://infinispan.org/docs/dev/user_guide/user_guide.html#jpa_hibernate_2l_cache[Documentation]
added on how to use Hibernate 5.2 and 5.1 Infinispan cache providers
shipped with Infinispan 9.2.

Full details of the new features and enhancements included in this
release can be found

Cheers,
