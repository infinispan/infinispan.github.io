Dears,

we're pleased to announce that 8.1.0.CR1 release for C++/C# clients is
out! Downloading the code you'll find these changes (and may more):

* C++11 instead of the old portable custom classes
* less bugs
* more safety through TLS client authentication

We're getting closer to a final release, more updates on what's going on

Enjoy!
