The amount of feedback we've had on Infinispan 5.2.0.CR2 has been
tremendous, and so we considered that Infinispan was not ready to go
Final yet, so we decided to do another candidate release, called
5.2.0.CR3.

In this candidate release, we've got rid of the RHQ annotations
dependency, so Infinispan Core has now one less dependency thanks to the
integration of RHQ annotations with our own JMX annotations.

The areas containing the most important fixes are Distributed Caches and
the Hot Rod server, so if you're a user of these features, we'd highly
recommend that you give CR3 a go. Check the full
https://issues.jboss.org/issues/?jql=project%20%3D%20ISPN%20AND%20fixVersion%20%3D%20%225.2.0.CR3%22%20AND%20status%20%3D%20Resolved%20ORDER%20BY%20priority%20DESC[release
notes] for detailed information on the issues fixed.
