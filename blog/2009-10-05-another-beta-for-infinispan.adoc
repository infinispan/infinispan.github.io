Rather than releasing a CR1 so soon, I have decided to cut another beta
instead, mainly due to the sheer volume of changes since the last beta.
So here is what you have to look forward to. A pile of bugs fixed thanks
to reports made by you, the community. A couple of packages upgraded,
including JGroups (to 2.8.0.CR2) and JBoss Marshalling (to 1.2.0.CR4).
And two new modules introduced: a tech preview of the

API], and the new
http://infinispan.blogspot.com/2009/09/introducing-infinispan-rest-server.html[RESTful
server module], thanks to Navin and Michael accordingly. A full list of
issues addressed in this release is available on
https://jira.jboss.org/jira/secure/ConfigureReport.jspa?versions=12314028&sections=.1.7.2.4.10.9.8.3.12.11.5&style=none&selectedProjectId=12310799&reportKey=pl.net.mamut%3Areleasenotes&Next=Next[JIRA].



We're pushing hard for a series of CRs now, to solidify the codebase and
make sure it exceeds expectations in performance, scalability, stability
and ease of use. Your feedback has always been valuable, please keep it
coming!



This release is available for
http://www.jboss.org:80/infinispan/downloads.html[download in the usual
place], and the http://www.jboss.org/community/wiki/infinispan[wiki]
should be used as your primary port-of-call for documentation. Discuss
issues on the
http://www.jboss.org/index.html?module=bb&op=viewforum&f=309[user
forum], and don't forget to http://twitter.com/infinispan[tweet about

Enjoy
