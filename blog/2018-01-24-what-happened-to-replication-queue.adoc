Recently I saw an Infinispan user that was having issues using the
replication queue, a clustering functionality that had been part of
Infinispan since it's first release. Looking at the latest Infinispan
codebase I realised it wasn't there any more, what happened to it?

The aim of the replication queue was to batch individual cache
operations and send them as one to other nodes, rather than sending them
each operation individually.

Over time we started considering whether the replication queue could be
removed:


. The replication queue was duplicating functionality: JGroups, which
manages the group communication layer, already bundles messages and the
network stack can do it too.
. Using the replication queue was not more efficient because when the
message is delivered in the remote node, the messages are processed
sequentially. If processing first message blocks, the other commands are
not processed until it finishes.
. It can add complexity if messages with different order requirements
come in same batch, e.g. no order, FIFO or total.

In essence, Infinispan's replication queue was doing the same as
JGroups' message bundler. Whereas JGroups' message bundler had been
evolving and different options had been developed, Infinispan's
replication queue was still using same algorithm as in its first
release.

So in Infinispan 8.2 the replication queue was deprecated and in 9.0 it
was finally removed. If you ever find the need to batch your changes,
configure

message bundler].
