Pessimistic transactions were added in 5.1 and are the "rebranding" of
eager transactions from previous Infinispan releases. But besides the
re-branding, the code also brought some worth mentioning performance
optimisation:

* a single RPC happens for acquiring lock on a key, disregarding the
number of invocations. So if you call _cache.put(k,v)_ in a loop, within
the scope of the same transaction, there is only one remote call to the
owner of _k_.
* if the key you want to lock/write maps to the local node then no
remote locks are acquired. In other words there won't be any RPCs for
writing to a key that maps locally. This can be very powerful used in
conjunction with the
https://docs.jboss.org/author/x/IwY5[KeyAffinityService], as it allows
you to control the locality of you keys.
* during the two phase commit (2PC), the prepare phase doesn't perform
any RPCs: this optimisation is based on the fact locks are already
acquired on each write. This means that then number of RPCs during
transactions lifespan is reduced with 1.
* for some writes to the cache (e..g _cache.put(k,v)_) two RPCs were
performed: one to acquire the remote lock and one to fetch the previous
value. The obvious optimisation in this case was to make a single RPC
for both operations - which we do starting with 5.1.

Enjoy!
