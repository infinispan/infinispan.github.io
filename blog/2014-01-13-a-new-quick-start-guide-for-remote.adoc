Following up on the previous post on
http://blog.infinispan.org/2013/09/embedded-and-remote-queries-in.html[Infinispan
remote queries], we've prepared a quick start guide to get you up and
running with remote queries in minutes.

It's a simple Java application that places some data in a remote cache
and then retrieves it using queries over Hot Rod. On top of that, the
project also contains a C++ companion app contributed by
https://github.com/isavin[Ion Savin] that uses the
https://github.com/infinispan/cpp-client/[C++ Hot Rod client] and is
able to read and write (but not query, yet) the same data, demonstrating
interoperability between C++ and Java clients. At this point the
Protobuf encoding support comes in a few C++ external helper classes
rather than being part of the C++ client, but this is going to improve
in the upcoming versions.
 
The code for this app is hosted on
https://github.com/jboss-developer/jboss-jdg-quickstarts/tree/master/remote-query[Github]
under the
https://github.com/jboss-developer/jboss-jdg-quickstarts[jboss-jdg-quickstarts]
project.
Please note this tutorial was written for the JBoss Data Grid (JDG), but
it applies to Infinispan as well. We welcome you to try it and let us
know what you think!
