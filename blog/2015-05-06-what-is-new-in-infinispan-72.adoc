Dear community,



We have recently released Infinispan 7.2, and we feel it deserves a more
detailed introduction. This release brings important new features, code
optimizations and major bug fixes.

*
*

What features can be found?

*
*

* We have introduced a new factory for the atomic object. The new
factory is based on a replicated state machine, and it allows object
creation on top of Infinispan cache e.g. Java collections. 
* Server-side scripting allows custom script installation in Infinispan
server and their invocation over Hot Rod. You can now use map/reduce and
distributed executor over Hot Rod as well. 
* JCache (JSR-107) support over Hot Rod.
* Near cache support for Hot Rod Java client.
* Support for defining filters using the Query DSL for event listeners.
* DSL-based filters are indexed for faster and more scalable evaluation.
* Custom cache stores deployment in Infinispan server.

*
*

What optimizations have been made?

*
*

* Eviction improvements with new long size support and more accurate
eviction.
* Many indexing improvements.
* Faster bulk operations (putAll() and getAll()) for both embedded and
Hot Rod client.
* Cache creation and configuration changes do not require Infinispan
server restart. 
* Faster clear operation. It is now lock-free and non-transactional, and
it shouldn't be invoked with other concurrent operations.

*
*

What bugs have been fixed?

*
*

* DummyTransactionManager has been fixed and made more reliable.
Although we recommend a use of a proper TransactionManager, it can be
used for simpler applications which don't involve additional resource
enlistments.
* Fixed deadlocks and errors during topology changes. Adding and
removing nodes works smoothly and faster now.
* Multiple tweaks in CLI operations.
* Other small bug fixes.

*
*

Finally, we would like thank all community members involved in this
release. A special thank you to *Pierre Sutra* (atomic object factory
contribution), *Damiano Albani* (dependency fixes) and *Karl von Randow*
(configuration fixes)
