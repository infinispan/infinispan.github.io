Are you afraid the Death Star or the Vogon Constructor Fleet are going
to blow up your data on the Earth ? 
Navin Surtani has recorded a nice
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPOvwBelAlk[video] demonstrating the use
of JBoss Data Grid Cross-Site Replication and how it can be used to keep
backups of your precious data off-site.

The code for the demo is also
