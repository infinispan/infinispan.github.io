Today we present to you a trifecta of cache store releases which align
to Infinispan 9.x

== Cassandra Cache Store

The Cassandra cache store now implements the
https://docs.jboss.org/infinispan/9.4/apidocs/org/infinispan/persistence/spi/AdvancedCacheLoader.html#publishEntries(java.util.function.Predicate,boolean,boolean)[publishEntries/publishKeys]
methods.

== Cloud Cache Store

The Cloud cache store uses the Apache jclouds library to store data on
cloud storage providers such as Amazon’s S3, Rackspace’s Cloudfiles or
any other such provider supported by JClouds.
The store has been updated to Infinispan 9.x's persistence SPI and uses
jclouds 2.1.x

== MongoDB Cache Store

This cache store has also been updated to the Infinispan 9.x persistence
SPI.

You can get documentation and maven coordinates from our
http://infinispan.org/cache-store-implementations/[Cache Store page]
