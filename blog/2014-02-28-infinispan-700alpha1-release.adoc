Dear Infinispan community,

We're proud to announce the first Alpha release of Infinispan 7.0.0.

This release adds several new features:

* Support for clustered listeners. One of the limitation of Infinispan's
distributed mode used to be that listeners could only receive events for
cache modifications on their own node. That's no longer the case, and it
paves the way for a long-requested feature: HotRod listeners.

* Map/Reduce tasks can now execute the mapper/combiner/reducer
http://blog.infinispan.org/2014/02/mapreduce-parallel-execution.html[on
multiple threads]. Stay tuned for more Map/Reduce improvements in the
near future.

* The first essential component of cache security has been added, which
will be the building block for remote protocol authentication and
authorization.

* Improved OSGi support in the HotRod Java client. The core components
are also getting into shape for OSGi, expect more on this front in the
next release.


As you can see, many of the new features are stepping stones for bigger
things yet to come. Feel free to join us and shape the future releases
