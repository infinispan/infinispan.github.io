Infinispan 5.1.5.CR1 has just been released with a handful of crucial
issues that we considered required another community release. If you're
a https://issues.jboss.org/browse/ISPN-2036[tree module user in JBoss
AS7], or a https://issues.jboss.org/browse/ISPN-1995[an elastic Hot Rod
server user],  or https://issues.jboss.org/browse/ISPN-2023[use XA
datasources with Infinispan JDBC cache store], you should definitely
upgrade to this version!

Infinispan 5.1 _'Brahma'_ is a key component for a lot of projects both
within and outside the boundaries of Red Hat, and this is reflected in
all the micro releases we've done for _'Brahma'_ as Infinispan consumers
near their final releases. From here I'd like to personally thank all
the people behind these projects who have been crucial to the
development of Infinispan. Expect a 5.1.5.FINAL in the next days which
should wrap up the _'Brahma'_ release lifecycle barring a show-stopper!
:)



As always, full details of what has been fixed can be found
