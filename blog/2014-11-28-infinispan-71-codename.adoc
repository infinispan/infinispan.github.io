It's that time of the development cycle when we get to decide the most
important feature that will be part of our next release: the codename.

As usual, it must be chosen among a selection of fermented barley, hops,
yeast and water aka beer.

A bit of history for reference:

4.0 Starobrno
4.1 Radegast
4.2 Ursus
5.0 Pagoa
5.1 Brahma
5.2 Delirium
5.3 Tactical Nuclear Penguin
6.0 Infinium
7.0 Guinness

You have until Friday, 5th December 2014 at 12:00 GMT to cast your
