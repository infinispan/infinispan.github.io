Since the
http://blog.infinispan.org/2014/04/infinispan-security-1-authorization.html[last
post] on Infinispan Security, there have been a few changes related to
how we handle authorization in Infinispan. All of these are available in
the recently released 7.0.0.Alpha5.


== Authorization Performance

Previously we mentioned the need to use a _SecurityManager_ and
javax.security.auth.Subject.doAs() in order to achieve authorization in
embedded mode. Unfortunately those components have a severe performance
impact. In particular, retrieving the current _Subject_ from the
_AccessControlContext_ adds, on my test environment, 3.5µs per call.
Since the execution of a _Cache.put_ takes about 0.5µs when
authorization is not in use, this means that every invocation is 8x
slower.

For this reason we have introduced an alternative for those of you
(hopefully the majority), that do not need to use a _SecurityManager_
and can avoid the _AccessControlContext_: invoke your
_PrivilegedActions_ using the new
org.infinispan.security.Security.doAs() method, which uses a
_ThreadLocal_ to store the current _Subject_. Using this new approach,
the overhead per invocation falls to 0.5µs: a 7x improvement !
_Security.doAs()_ is actually smart: if it detects that a
_SecurityManager_ is in use, it will fallback to retrieving the
_Subject_ via the _AccessControlContext_, so you don't need to decide
what approach you will be using in production. The following chart shows
the impact of using each approach when compared to running without
authorization:

== Auditing


An essential part of an authorization framework, is the ability to track
WHO is doing WHAT (or is being prevented from doing it !). Infinispan
now offers a pluggable audit framework which you can use to track the
execution of cache/container operations. The default audit logger sends
audit messages to your logging framework of choice (e.g. Log4J), but you
can write your own to take any appropriate actions you deem appropriate
for your security policies.

As usual, for more details, check out the
http://infinispan.org/docs/7.0.x/user_guide/user_guide.html#_security[Security
chapter] in the Infinispan documentation and the
https://docs.jboss.org/infinispan/7.0/apidocs/org/infinispan/security/package-summary.html[org.infinispan.security]
JavaDocs.
