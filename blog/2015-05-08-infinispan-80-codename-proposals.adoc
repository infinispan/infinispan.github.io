With 7.2 out of the door, it is time to decide the codename for
Infinispan 8.0. By tradition it has always been the name of a beer, and
we must not break a good tradition !

4.0 Starobrno
4.1 Radegast
4.2 Ursus
5.0 Pagoa
5.1 Brahma
5.2 Delirium
5.3 Tactical Nuclear Penguin
6.0 Infinium
7.0 Guinness
7.1 Hoptimus Prime
7.2 Insanely Bad Elf

Before we ask the community to vote for their preferred
beer^H^H^H^Hcodename we would like to create a shortlist of really good
beer names that you think would be appropriate. You have until Friday,
15th May 2015 at 12:00 GMT to make your submission, either in the form
below or by going to the http://goo.gl/forms/CZ8gtmyln8[survey].
