Infinispan's been fortunate enough to have Pete Muir - of
http://seamframework.org/[Seam], http://seamframework.org/Weld[Weld] and
http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=299[the JSR-299/CDI spec] fame -  join
us.  More details are on
http://in.relation.to/Bloggers/SeamAndWeldLeadershipChanges[Pete's
blog] on the subject.  Pete's work on Seam has been legendary, with
particular regard to fostering and encouraging a very active community,
while at the same time pushing the boundaries of Java EE.  With Pete's
interest in
http://www.inf.ed.ac.uk/publications/thesis/online/IM050248.pdf[distributed
NoSQL databases and in-memory data grids], expect to see the same on
Infinspan!

Welcome aboard, Pete - we're all very excited to have you on board!
:-)

Cheers
Manik
