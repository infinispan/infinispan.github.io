In fact the <a href="https://issues.jboss.org/browse/ISPN-4222">first iteration</a> wasn&#8217;t until Infinispan 7. Then in Infinispan 8, with the addition of Java 8, we fully integrated this into <a href="http://blog.infinispan.org/2015/09/distributed-streams.html">distributed streams</a>, which brought some minor iteration improvements in performance.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>We are proud to announce that with Infinispan 9.2 there are even more improvements. This contains no API changes, although those will surely come in the future. This one is purely for performance and utilization.</p> </div> </div> </div> <div class="sect1"> <h2 id="_new_implementation_details"><a class="anchor" href="#_new_implementation_details"></a>New implementation details</h2> <div class="sectionbody"> <div class="sect2"> <h3 id=""><a class="anchor" href="#"></a> </h3> <div class="paragraph"> <p>There are a few different aspects that have been changed.  A lot of these revolve around the amount of entries being retrieved at once, which if you are familiar with DistributedStreams can be configured via the <a href="https://docs.jboss.org/infinispan/9.2/apidocs/org/infinispan/BaseCacheStream.html#distributedBatchSize-int-">distributedBatchSize</a> method. Note that if this is not specified it defaults to the <a href="https://docs.jboss.org/infinispan/9.2/apidocs/org/infinispan/configuration/cache/StateTransferConfigurationBuilder.html#chunkSize-int-">chunk size</a> in state transfer.</p> </div> <div class="sect3"> <h4 id="_entry_retrieval_is_now_pull_based_instead_of_push"><a class="anchor" href="#_entry_retrieval_is_now_pull_based_instead_of_push"></a>Entry retrieval is now pull based instead of push</h4> <div class="paragraph"> <p>Infinispan core (embedded) has added <a href="https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava/tree/2.x">rxjava2</a> and <a href="https://github.com/reactive-streams/reactive-streams-jvm">reactive streams</a> as dependencies and rewrote all of the old push style iterator code over to pull style to fully utilize the Publisher and Subscriber interfaces.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>With this we only pull up to the batchSize in entries at a time from any set of nodes. The old style utilized push with call stack blocking, which could return up two times the amount of entries. Also since we aren&#8217;t performing call stack blocking, we don&#8217;t have to waste threads as these calls to retrieve entries are done async and finish very quickly irrespective of user interaction. The old method required multiple threads to be reserved for this purpose.</p> </div> </div> <div class="sect3"> <h4 id="_streamed_batches"><a class="anchor" href="#_streamed_batches"></a>Streamed batches</h4> <div class="paragraph"> <p>The responses from a remote node are written directly to the output stream so there are no intermediate collections allocated. This means we only have to iterate upon the data once as we retain the iterator between requests. On the originator we still have to store the batches in a collection to be enqueued for the user to pull.</p> </div> </div> <div class="sect3"> <h4 id="_rewritten_parallel_distribution"><a class="anchor" href="#_rewritten_parallel_distribution"></a>Rewritten Parallel Distribution</h4> <div class="paragraph"> <p>Great care was taken to implement parallel distribution in a way to vastly reduce contention and ensure that we properly follow the batchSize configuration.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>When parallel distribution is in use the new implementation will start 4 remote node requests sharing the batch size (so each one gets 1/4). This way we can guarantee that we only have the desired size irrespective of the number of nodes in the cluster. The old implementation would request batchSize from all nodes at the same time. So not only did it reserve a thread for node but could easily swamp your JVM memory, causing OutOfMemoryErrors (which no one likes). The latter alone made us force the default to be sequential distribution when using an iterator.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>The old implementation would write entries from all nodes (including local) to the same shared queue. The new implementation has a different queue for each request, which allows for faster queues with no locking to be used.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>Due to these changes and other isolations between threads, we can now make parallel distribution the default setting for the iterator method. And as you will see this has improved performance nicely.</p> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div class="sect1"> <h2 id="_performance"><a class="anchor" href="#_performance"></a>Performance</h2> <div class="sectionbody"> <div class="paragraph"> <p>We have written a <a href="http://openjdk.java.net/projects/code-tools/jmh/">JMH</a> test harness specifically for this blog post, testing 9.1.5.Final <a href="https://github.com/infinispan/infinispan/releases/tag/9.1.5.Final">build</a> against latest 9.2.0.SNAPSHOT. The test runs by default with 4GB of heap with 6 nodes in a distributed cache with 2 owners. It has varying entry count, entry sizes and distributed batch sizes.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>Due to the variance in each test a large number of tests were ran and with different permutations to make sure it covered a large amount of test cases. The JMH test that was ran can be found at <a href="https://github.com/infinispan/infinispan-benchmarks/tree/master/iteration">github</a>. All the default settings were used for the run except -t4 (runs with 4 worker threads) was provided. This was all ran on my measly laptop (i7-4810MQ and 16 GB) - maxing out the CPU was not a hard task.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p><strong>CAVEAT</strong>: The tests don&#8217;t do anything with the iterator and just try to pull them as fast as they can. Obviously if you have a lot of processing done between iterations you will likely not see as good of a performance increase.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>The entire results can be found <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18v8e6vG-4aX8Pk-ihB3p1H5cQvsSQlFMhQSKxPhSLf0/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>. It shows each permutation and how many operations per second and finds the difference (green shows 5% or more and red shows -5% or less).</p> </div> <table class="tableblock frame-all grid-all stretch"> <colgroup> <col style="width: 33.3333%;"> <col style="width: 33.3333%;"> <col style="width: 33.3334%;"> </colgroup> <thead> <tr> <th class="tableblock halign-left valign-top">Operation</th> <th class="tableblock halign-left valign-top">Average Gain</th> <th class="tableblock halign-left valign-top">Code</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td class="tableblock halign-left valign-top"><p class="tableblock">Specified Distribution Mode</p></td> <td class="tableblock halign-left valign-top"><p class="tableblock">3.5%</p></td> <td class="tableblock halign-left valign-top"><p class="tableblock">.entrySet().stream().sequentialDistribution.iterator()</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="tableblock halign-left valign-top"><p class="tableblock">Default</p></td> <td class="tableblock halign-left valign-top"><p class="tableblock">11%</p></td> <td class="tableblock halign-left valign-top"><p class="tableblock">.entrySet().iterator()</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="tableblock halign-left valign-top"><p class="tableblock">No Rehash</p></td> <td class="tableblock halign-left valign-top"><p class="tableblock">14%</p></td> <td class="tableblock halign-left valign-top"><p class="tableblock">.entrySet().stream().disableRehashAware().iterator()</p></td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <div class="paragraph"> <p>The above 3 rows show a few different ways you could have been invoking the iterator method. The second row is probably by far the most used case. In this case you should see around a <strong>11</strong>% increase in performance (results will vary). This is due to the new pulling method as well as parallel distribution becoming the new default running mode. It is unlikely a user was using the other 2 methods, but are provided for a more complete view.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>If you were specifying a distribution mode manually, either sequential or distribution you will only see a few percent faster run (<strong>3.5</strong>%), but every little bit helps! Also if you can switch to parallel you may want to think about doing so.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>Also you can see if you were running with rehash disabled prior, it has even more gains (<strong>14</strong>%). Those don&#8217;t even include the fact that no rehash was <strong>28</strong>% faster than with before (which means it is about <strong>32</strong>% faster in general now). So if you can get away with a <em>at most once</em> guarantee, disabling rehash will provide the best throughput.</p> </div> </div> </div> <div class="sect1"> <h2 id="_whats_next"><a class="anchor" href="#_whats_next"></a>Whats next? </h2> <div class="sectionbody"> <div class="paragraph"> <p>As was mentioned this is not exposed to the user directly. You still interact with the iterator as you would normally. We should remedy this at some point.</p> </div> <div class="sect2"> <h3 id="_expose_new_method"><a class="anchor" href="#_expose_new_method"></a>Expose new method</h3> <div class="paragraph"> <p>We would love to eventually expose a method to return a Publisher directly to the user so that they can get the full benefits of having a pull based implementation underneath.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>This way any intermediate operations applied to the stream before would be distributed and anything applied to the Publisher would be done locally. And just like the iterator method this publisher would be fully rehash aware if you have it configured to do so and would make sure you get all entries delivered in an <em>exactly once</em> fashion (rehash disabled guarantees <em>at most once</em>).</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>Another side benefit is that the Subscriber methods could be called on different threads so there is no overhead required on the ISPN side for coordinating these into queue(s). Thus the Subscriber <em>should</em> be able to retrieve all entries faster than just doing an iterator.</p> </div> </div> <div class="sect2"> <h3 id="_java_9_flow"><a class="anchor" href="#_java_9_flow"></a>Java 9 Flow</h3> <div class="paragraph"> <p>Also many of you may be wondering why we aren&#8217;t using the new Flow API introduced in Java 9. Luckily the Flow API is a 1:1 conversion of reactive streams. So whenever Infinispan will start supporting Java 9 interfaces/classes, we hope to properly expose these as the JDK classes.</p> </div> </div> <div class="sect2"> <h3 id="_segment_based_iteration"><a class="anchor" href="#_segment_based_iteration"></a>Segment Based Iteration </h3> <div class="paragraph"> <p>With Infinispan 9.3, we hope to introduce <a href="https://issues.jboss.org/browse/ISPN-5451">data container</a> and <a href="https://issues.jboss.org/browse/ISPN-6026">cache store</a> segment aware iteration. This means when iterating over either we would only have to process entries that map to a given segment. This should reduce the time and processing for iteration substantially, especially for cache stores. Keep your eyes out for a future blog post detailing these as 9.3 development commences.</p> </div> </div> <div class="sect2"> <h3 id="_give_us_feedback"><a class="anchor" href="#_give_us_feedback"></a>Give us Feedback</h3> <div class="paragraph"> <p>We hope you find a bit more performance when working with your distributed iteration. Also we value any feedback on what you want our APIs to look like or find any bugs. As always let us know at any of the places listed <a href="http://infinispan.org/community/">here</a>.</p> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <hr> <div class="post"></div> <h3> Sunday, 18 February 2018 </h3> <h1> <a href="/blog/2018/02/18/thanks-jfokus/">Thanks JFokus!!</a> </h1> <div class="content"> <div id="preamble"> <div class="sectionbody"> <div class="paragraph"> <p>We&#8217;re now back from JFokus and we&#8217;d like to thank organizers, attendees, volunteers and sponsors for making JFokus a very enjoyable experience! :)</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>From an Infinispan perspective, we started the week with a Streaming Data deep-dive session presented together with Clement Escoffier. This was a 3h long session, so there was plenty to go through but we managed to do it on time. The final demo did not fully work, but this is something we will improving it in the near future. Slides can be found in [<a href="http://bit.ly/streaming-data-dd-1">1</a>]</p> </div> <div class="paragraph ly/streaming-data-dd-2[2] ly/streaming-data-dd-3[3] ly/streaming-data-dd-4[4] ly/streaming-data-dd-5[5]"> <p>[<a href="http://bit.ly/streaming-data-dd-6">6</a>] and the code can be found <a href="http://bit.ly/streaming-data-dd-code">here</a>. This session was not recorded.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>Next day I had a talk on streaming data analysis on top of Kubernetes where I went through some of the topics explained in the deep dive. This was mostly a live coding session showing how to work with streaming data on top OpenShift/Kubernetes which run on Google Cloud. This session was recorded. I&#8217;ll keep an eye for when the video becomes available to share it here. The code from this session can be found <a href="http://bit.ly/sdk8s-code">here</a>, slides <a href="http://bit.ly/sdk8s-jfokus18-slides">here</a> and the live coding instructions <a href="http://bit.ly/sdk8s-jfokus18-lc">here</a>.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>The rest of the conference was a blast, with many networking opportunities. During this networking I started working on an RxJava2 API facade for Infinispan remote API, which would make it easier to fit with other reactive toolkits out there, such as Vert.x :). More news on this soon</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>Cheers, Galder</p> </div> </div> </div> </div> <hr> <div class="post"></div> <h3> Thursday, 15 February 2018 </h3> <h1> <a href="/blog/2018/02/15/dear-infinispanners-c-and-c-8/"> Hotrod clients C++/C# 8.2.0.Beta1 are out!</a> </h1> <div class="content"> <div id="preamble"> <div class="sectionbody"> <div class="paragraph"> <p>Dear Infinispanners, C++ and C# 8.2.0.Beta1 releases are available!</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>These releases contain all the 8.2.0 features.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>Worth a mention is the improvement in the remote execution API: we moved the JBossMarshaller basic implementation from test to the distro in order to simplify the data management on the application side.

You can learn more info about Ickle in a <a href="http://blog.infinispan.org/2016/12/meet-ickle.html">previous post</a>.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>Besides exposing query over REST, Infinispan 9.2 also adds support for mapping between JSON and Protobuf formats, allowing an efficient storage in binary format while exposing queries, reading and writing content as JSON documents.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>To illustrate those new capabilities, this post will walk you through a sample app from scratch!</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>=== Sample app</p> </div> <div class="exampleblock"> <div class="content"> <div class="paragraph"> <p>Running the server</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>We start by <a href="https://github.com/jboss-dockerfiles/infinispan/tree/master/server">running</a> the Infinispan Server 9.2.0.CR2 (the latest release candidate):</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>This will get you a fresh instance of Infinispan running, with login and password 'user' and the REST port 8080 mapped to localhost. TIP: if you run more than one container, they&#8217;ll form a cluster automatically.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>===== Creating an indexed cache</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>Next step is to create an indexed cache called 'pokemon'. We make use of the CLI  (Command Line Interface) to create this cache. In the future, with <a href="https://issues.jboss.org/browse/ISPN-8529">ISPN-8529</a>, we&#8217;ll also be able to create cache with arbitrary configuration using REST, but for now we execute a CLI recipe:</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>===== Creating the schema</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>In order to be able to query, we need to define a protobuf schema for our data. The schema follows the Protobuf 2 format (Protobuf 3 support is coming) and allows for extensions to define indexing properties (analyzers, storage, etc).</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>Here&#8217;s how it looks like:</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>The protobuf schema can contain some comments on top of fields and messages with "annotations" to control indexing.

There have been quite a <a href="https://issues.jboss.org/browse/ISPN-8454?jql=project%20%3D%20ISPN%20AND%20resolution%20%3D%20Done%20AND%20component%20%3D%20%22Off%20Heap%22">few fixes</a> for Off Heap especially around memory size estimations with Infinispan 9.2. There is also a brand new "eviction" strategy that has a bit of a twist.</p> </div> </div> </div> <div class="sect1"> <h2 id="_eviction_strategy_resurrected"><a class="anchor" href="#_eviction_strategy_resurrected"></a>Eviction Strategy Resurrected</h2> <div class="sectionbody"> <div class="paragraph"> <p>Some of you may have remembered that Infinispan used to have an eviction strategy. This was originally used to decide what eviction algorithm was used, such as LRU or LIRS. This was removed when the new data container was introduced. Well&#8230;&#8203; it is back again, but it will be used for a slightly different purpose.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>The eviction strategy still has <strong>NONE</strong> &amp; <strong>MANUAL</strong> which are exactly the same as before.</p> </div> <div class="sect2"> <h3 id="_remove_strategy"><a class="anchor" href="#_remove_strategy"></a>Remove strategy</h3> <div class="paragraph"> <p>There is a new <strong>REMOVE</strong> strategy that is configured by default if eviction size is greater than 0. This strategy essentially enables eviction and removes old entries as new ones are inserted.</p> </div> </div> <div class="sect2"> <h3 id="_exception_strategy"><a class="anchor" href="#_exception_strategy"></a>Exception strategy</h3> <div class="paragraph"> <p>We have a brand new "eviction" strategy that provides new functionality. It is unique in that it doesn&#8217;t really evict, but rather prevent entries from being inserted.  This is the <strong>EXCEPTION</strong> strategy which blocks new entries from being inserted (or updated if they exceed memory size) by throwing a ContainerFullException when the size is reached.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>This strategy only works on transactional caches that always have 2 phase commit enabled. This can be useful if you want to always have only so many entries and to give priority to currently inserted entries. This strategy has better performance than <strong>REMOVE</strong> since it doesn&#8217;t have to bookkeep all entries to know what to remove as well.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>Note this strategy works across all storage types: OBJECT, BINARY and OFFHEAP and works with both MEMORY and SIZE based "eviction types. This makes it just as flexible as the <strong>REMOVE</strong> eviction strategy and hope it finds some uses by people.</p> </div> </div> <div class="sect2"> <h3 id="_how_to_configure_exception_strategy"><a class="anchor" href="#_how_to_configure_exception_strategy"></a>How to Configure EXCEPTION Strategy</h3> <div class="paragraph"> <p>This is how you can enable MEMORY based EXCEPTION "eviction" using xml configuration.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>This is how you configure the same thing but programmatically.</p> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div class="sect1"> <h2 id="_off_heap_memory_size_allocations_estimations"><a class="anchor" href="#_off_heap_memory_size_allocations_estimations"></a>Off Heap Memory Size Allocations &amp; Estimations</h2> <div class="sectionbody"> <div class="paragraph"> <p>Before the off heap memory based eviction only counted the allocated memory chunks for the stored entries themselves. This unfortunately meant that the size estimate is a bit less than what it should have been. There are a few things that we improved since then, including reducing the overhead of our allocations. Note all of the below things require no configuration changes and users should just get the benefits.</p> </div> <div class="sect2"> <h3 id="_reduced_per_object_overhead"><a class="anchor" href="#_reduced_per_object_overhead"></a>Reduced per object overhead</h3> <div class="paragraph"> <p>Prior the overhead for immutable entries with eviction, Infinispan itself use to allocate 2 chunks of memory with one being 28 bytes and adding 8 bytes to the actual object. Now we only allocate an additional 16 bytes to the object memory block itself (saving the extra allocation and requiring less on the object) when using eviction. Due to memory allocation overhead this saves much more than the 20 bytes as the allocator also has its own overhead.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>We also shaved off 4 bytes off of all entries if expiration was not used, meaning overhead for an immutable cache entry without eviction only requires 21 bytes of overhead from ISPN when using off heap (retained in the same allocation block).</p> </div> </div> <div class="sect2"> <h3 id="_per_allocation_memory_sizing_estimations"><a class="anchor" href="#_per_allocation_memory_sizing_estimations"></a>Per allocation memory sizing estimations</h3> <div class="paragraph"> <p>Internally ISPN allocates a new chunk of memory for each object. This is done currently to leverage the underlying OS allocator to handle features such as fragmentation or compaction (if the allocator does so). Unfortunately this means that each object has its own overhead from the allocator. Thus we now take that into account when estimating the memory used by adding 8 bytes overhead and aligning to 16 bytes. This seems to be a pretty common way for allocators to work. If possible we could allow for tweaking these values, but they are hard coded currently.</p> </div> </div> <div class="sect2"> <h3 id="_accounting_for_address_count"><a class="anchor" href="#_accounting_for_address_count"></a>Accounting for Address Count</h3> <div class="paragraph"> <p>As was mentioned in the prior blog post about off heap, we allocate a single block of memory to hold address counters for our lookups when using Off Heap. Unfortunately we didn&#8217;t account for that in the memory eviction count. We now account for that in the eviction mechanism, thus your memory eviction size must be greater than the address count rounded up to the nearest power of 2, multiplied by 8. What a mouthful&#8230;&#8203;</p> </div> </div> <div class="sect2"> <h3 id="_wrap_up"><a class="anchor" href="#_wrap_up"></a>Wrap up</h3> <div class="paragraph"> <p>Off heap has been overhauled quite a bit to try to reduce memory usage, fix bugs and more accurately estimate the memory used. We hope that along with the new eviction strategy are welcome additions to various applications.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>Please make sure to contact us if you have any feedback, find any bugs or have any questions!
