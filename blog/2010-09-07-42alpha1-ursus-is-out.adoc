Hi *,

4.2.ALPHA1 has just been released!
Besides other things, it contains following two features:
- supports deadlock detection for eagerly locking transactions (new)
- an very interesting optimisation for eager locking, which allows one
to benefit from eager locking semantics with the same performance as
"lazy" locking. You can read more about this
http://community.jboss.org/wiki/LockingandConcurrency#Locking_a_single_remote_node[here].
For download information go

features refer to
https://jira.jboss.org/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?projectId=12310799&version=12315393[the
release notes].
