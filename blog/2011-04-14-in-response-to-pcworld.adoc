PCWorld has published
http://www.pcworld.com/businesscenter/article/225190/red_hat_cache_move_sparks_standards_spat.html[an
article] on the recent data grid JSR that I have submitted.  As a
follow-up to PCWorld's article, I would like to make a few comments to
clarify a few things.

I don't quite understand what is meant by Red Hat's approach not being
the best solution.  Do people take issue with having a standard in the
first place?  Or is it the standards body used in this particular case
(the JCP)?  If it is the details of the standard itself, one should keep
in mind that this has _yet to be defined_ by an expert group!

It is unfortunate that the _"others"_ mentioned in the article - who
feel that Red Hat's approach is not the best - were not able to provide
any details about their objections. I would love to hear these
objections and make sure that the JSR addresses them.

The importance of a standard, to remove vendor lock-in, etc., is pretty
well understood, so I won't go into too much detail here.  But with that
in mind, I find Pandey's comment regarding a _"self-beneficial move"_ an
odd one.  A standard makes it easier for people to switch between
products (which may explain why no one else may have stepped up to the
plate to propose such a standard thus far).  Proposing a standard makes
it easier for end-users to _move away_ from Infinispan.  Yes, it may
help with awareness of Infinispan, but it also means Red Hat, just like
other data grid vendors, will need to work _really hard_ to make sure
their products are up to scratch.  The only real beneficiary here is the
end-user.  In fact, I'd like to invite Terracotta to participate in this
JSR, as participation can only make it stronger, more relevant and
eventually even more useful to end-users.

With regards to JSR-107, I believe Pandey has misunderstood the
intention in proposing a data grid JSR.  I have proposed extending and
building _on top of_ JSR-107 - not throwing it away - and I have
expressed this the JSR-107 expert group mailing list, of which
Terracotta's Greg Luck is a member.  In fact, without Pandey's actually
seeing my

grid proposal blog post] - PCWorld's article was written _before_ I
published details of the JSR submission, based on a high-level Red Hat

release] - one has to wonder where such strong words come from!  :-)
