Shortly after the first Hot Rod server implementation was released in
2010, https://issues.jboss.org/browse/ISPN-374[ISPN-374] was created
requesting cache events to be forwarded back to connected clients. Even
though embedded caches have had access to these events since
Infinispan's first release, propagating them to remote clients has taken
a while, due to the increased complexity involved.

For Infinispan 7.0, we've finally addressed this. This is the first post
in a series that looks at Hot Rod Remote Events and the different
functionality we've implemented for this release. On this first post, we
show you how to get started with Hot Rod Remote Events with the most
basic of examples:

Start by downloading the Server distribution for the latest 7.0 (or
higher) release from http://infinispan.org/download/[Infinispan's
download page]. The server contains the Hot Rod server with which the
client will communicate. Once downloaded, start it up running the
following from the root of the server:

./bin/standalone.sh

Next up, we need to write a little application that interacts with the
Hot Rod server. If you're using Maven, create an application with this
dependency, changing version to 7.0.0.Beta1 or higher:


If not using Maven, adjust according to your chosen build tool or
download the all distribution with all Infinispan jars.

With the application dependencies in place, we need to start to write
the client application. We'll start with a simple remote event listener
that simply logs all events received:

Now it's time to write a simple main java class which adds the remote
event listener and executes some operations against the remote cache:


Once executed, we should see a console console output similar to this:


As you can see from the output, by default events come with the key and
the internal data version associated with the current value. The actual
value is not shipped back to the client for performance reasons.
Clearly, receiving remote events has a cost, and as the cache size
increases and more operations are executed, more events will be
generated. To avoid inundating Hot Rod clients, remote events can either
be filtered server side, or the event contents can be customised. In the
next blog post in this series, we will see this functionality in
action.

Cheers,
Galder
