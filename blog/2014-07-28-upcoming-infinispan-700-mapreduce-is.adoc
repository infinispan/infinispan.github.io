=== Introduction



Our enthusiasm about Infinispan Map/Reduce implementation has been a
driving impetus for new features and spectacular performance
improvements we have achieved in the past months. As we approach the
final Infinispan 7 release, we can not keep quiet about these
improvements any longer. We wanted to share the most significant new
Map/Reduce features as well as a rather important performance
improvement along with the details on how we achieved it.


=== New features



In the new features category, the most notable is a scalability
improvement that allows storage of MapReduceTask's results in a
distributed cache instead of returning results to the calling
application. Infinispan now gives users the option to specify a target
cache to store the results of an executed MapReduceTask. The results are
available after the execute method (which is synchronous) completes.
This new variant of the execute method prevents the master JVM node from
exceeding its allowed maximum heap size.  Users could, for example,
utilize the new execute method if objects that are the results of the
reduce phase have a large memory footprint or if multiple MapReduceTasks
are concurrently executing on the master task node. We have provided two
variants of the new execute method:


We also enhanced parallel execution of map/reduce functions at each node
and improved handling of intermediate results. Users can now specify
custom intermediate cache for a particular MapReduceTask.


=== Performance improvements



Infinispan 7 makes a rather big leap from a single threaded to a
parallel execution model of both map and reduce phases on each
Infinispan grid node. The final result of this change is on average
fivefold faster execution of your typical MapReduceTask.

Even though map and reduce phases are sequential we can still execute
the map and reduce phases themselves in parallel. If you recall,
although Infinispan 6 executes map and reduce phases on all nodes in
parallel, execution on each node itself is single-threaded. Similarly,
reduce phase although executed on multiple nodes in parallel, each node
executes its portion of the reduction on a single thread.

Since we baselined Infinispan 7 on JDK 7, we decided to experiment with
fork/join threading framework for parallel execution of both map and
reduce phases [2]. If you recall fork/join framework enables high
performance, parallel, fine-grained task execution in Java. Although
parallel, recursively decomposable tasks are well suited for fork/join
framework it may come as a surprise that parallel iteration of entries
in arrays, maps and other collections represents a good fit as well. And
do we have a well-suited candidate for parallel fork/join iteration -
cache's data container itself! In fact, most of the work is related to
iterating entries from the data container and invoking map/combine and
reduce function on those entries.

Map/combine phase is particularly interesting. Even if we use the
fork/join framework map and combine phases are distinct and until now -
serially executed. Having serial execution of map and combine is not the
only downside as map phase can be rather memory intensive. After all, it
has to store all intermediate results into provided collectors. Combine
phase takes produced intermediate values for a particular key and
combines it into a single intermediate value. Therefore, it would very
useful to periodically invoke combine on map produced keys/values thus
limiting the total amount of memory used for map phase. So the question
is how do we execute map/combine in parallel efficiently thus speeding
up execution and at the same time limiting the memory used? We found the
answer in producer/consumer threading paradigm.

In our case producers are fork/join threads that during map phase
iterate key/value data container and invoke Mapper's map function. Map
function transformation produces intermediate results stored into the
Infinispan provided queue of collectors. Consumers are also fork/join
threads that invoke combine function on key/value entries in those
collectors. Note that this way map/combine phase execution itself
becomes parallel, and phases of mapping and combing are no longer
serial. In the end, we have notably lowered memory usage and
significantly improved overall speed execution of map/combine algorithm
at the same time.


=== Performance lab results



Although http://blog.infinispan.org/2014/06/mapreduce-performance-improvements.html[initial] performance
results were more than promising, we were not satisfied. The throughput
peaked for 32KB cache values but was much lower for larger and smaller
values in our tests. We went back to the drawing board and devised the
above-described map/combine algorithm using fork/join framework and
producer/consumer approach. This time the results from the performance
lab were excellent. For more details on performance tests and hardware
used please refer to [1].

As you can see from the graphs below we have improved performance for
all cache value sizes. We were not able to significantly improve
throughput for the largest 1MB and 2MB cache values. For all other cache
value sizes, we have seen on average five-fold throughput improvement.
As throughput improvement is directly proportional to MapReduceTask
speed of execution improvement, our users should expect their
MapReduceTasks to execute, on average, five times faster in Infinispan 7
than in Infinispan 6.
