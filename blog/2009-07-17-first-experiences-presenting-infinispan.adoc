Last week was one of the most exciting weeks for me since joining the
http://www.jboss.org/infinispan[Infinispan] team because for the very
first time, I was going to present Infinispan to the world :)

Firstly last Tuesday, I introduced Infinispan to
http://www.jugs.ch/html/events/2009/infinispan.html[Switzerland]http://www.jugs.ch/html/events/2009/infinispan.html['s
Java User Group], where a crowd of around 20 people learned about the
usability improvements introduced, the performance and memory
consumption enhancements, and forthcoming new features. To finish the
presentation, I showed the audience a demo of 3
http://www.jboss.org/community/docs/DOC-10278[distributed] Infinispan
instances connected to an Amazon S3 cache store via
http://www.jclouds.org/[JClouds]. I received some very positive feedback
from the attendees who, in particular, were interested in finding out
http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/web/library/wa-cloudgrid/?ca=dgr-dth-cloudjw22CloudvsGrid&S_TACT=105AGX59&S_CMP=grsitejw22[the
differences between grid and cloud computing].

Two days later I went to Brussels to do the same presentation for
http://jbug.be/index.php?view=details&id=3%3Asummer-talks&option=com_eventlist&Itemid=53[Belgium's
JBoss User Group] and the reaction was even better there! A lot of
Spring developers attended the presentation who were very keen on
integrating Infinispan in their own projects.

From here I'd like to thank all the people who attended these two
sessions and in particular the organizers, Jakob Magun and Phillip Oser
from http://www.jugs.ch/index.html[Switzerland's Java User Group] and
Joris De Winne from http://jbug.be/[Belgium's JBoss User Group].

Cheers,
Galder
