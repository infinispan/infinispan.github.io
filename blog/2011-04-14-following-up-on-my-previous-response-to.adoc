Following up on
http://infinispan.blogspot.com/2011/02/jsr-107-and-jsr-on-data-grids.html[my
previous] response to
http://agoncal.wordpress.com/2011/02/11/java-ee-7-i-have-a-few-dreams/[Antonio
Goncalves]' blog post, I have submitted a JSR to the
http://www.jcp.org/[JCP] on a data grid standard, titled "_Java Data
Grids_".  It has yet to be assigned a number by the JCP, but I thought
I'd talk about it a little here anyway.

Here is the description of the JSR that I have submitted:

_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
This specification proposes to provide an API for accessing, storing,
and managing data in a distributed data grid.
The primary API will build upon and extend JSR-107 (JCACHE) API. In
addition to it’s genericized Map-like API to access a Cache, JSR-107
defines SPIs for spooling in-memory data to persistent storage, an API
for obtaining a named Cache from a CacheManager and an API to register
event listeners.
Above and beyond JSR-107, this JSR will define characteristics and
expectations from eviction, replication and distribution, and
transactions (via the JTA specification). Further, it would define an
asynchronous, non-blocking API as an alternative to JSR-107’s primary
API, as non-blocking access to data becomes a concern when an
implementation needs to perform remote calls, as in the case of a data
grid.
This specification builds upon JSR-107, which is not yet complete. We
intend to work with the JSR-107 EG to ensure that their schedule is
compatible with the schedule for this JSR. If JSR-107 is unable to
complete, we propose merging the last available draft into this
specification.

Data grids are gaining prominence and importance in enterprise Java,
particularly as cloud-style deployments gain popularity:


* Characteristics such as high availability, along with removal of
single points of failure become increasingly important, since cloud
infrastructure is inherently unreliable and can be re-provisioned with
minimal notice; applications deployed on cloud need to be resilient to
this.  
* Further, one of the major benefits of cloud-style deployments is
elasticity.  The ability to scale out (and back in) quickly and easily.
 Again, data grids have a role to play here.  
* Finally, with scalable middleware comes additional stress on the data
tier (traditionally an RDBMS), as middleware nodes scale out to cope
with load.  Data grids - used as a _distributed_ cache - can help with
mitigating database bottlenecks.


With one of Java EE 7's stated goals being _"cloud-friendliness"_, the
above are powerful arguments for the inclusion of a distributed data
grid standard in Java EE 7.

What about http://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=107[JSR-107]?  JSR-107 -
the temporary caching API proposed in 2001 - certainly has a role to
play in Java EE too.  Temporary caches are an important part of
enterprise middleware, but yet a standard has been sadly missing from a
Java EE umbrella specification for far too long.  Spring, having
identified the need as well, has a
http://static.springsource.org/spring/docs/3.1.0.M1/spring-framework-reference/html/cache.html[temporary
caching abstraction] in their current development versions.  Several
other non-Java frameworks define temporary caching APIs too
(http://guides.rubyonrails.org/caching_with_rails.html[Ruby on Rails],
http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.3/topics/cache/[Django for Python],
http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms972379.aspx[.NET]).  There is
no denying JSR-107 is necessary, and necessary as a part of Java EE.

But JSR-107 isn't a data grid.  JSR-107 falls short as a standard for
data grids, specifically as it doesn't take into account characteristics
of distribution and replication of data, and doesn't define a contract
that implementations would have to adhere to when it comes to moving
data around a cluster.  Crucial things for a data grid that, if not
baked into a specification, will hinder portability and render the
standard itself useless and impotent.

Further, with remote capabilities in mind, a data grid should also
expose a non-blocking API, since network calls can be a limiting factor.
 Invoking methods that involve remote calls should be able to be done in
an asynchronous fashion.  Stuff that is irrelevant to a temporary
caching API like JSR-107.

So with all that in mind, I'd love to hear your thoughts on the data
grid JSR.  In addition to Red Hat, the JSR is currently backed by a
major Java EE and data grid vendor which cannot be named at this stage,
along with independent JCP members with relevant interest and
background.
