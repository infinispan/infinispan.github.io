Infinispan users,

We have just released 9.3.0.Beta1 which
includes https://issues.jboss.org/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?projectId=12310799&version=12337255[38
fixes]. Highlights of this release include:

Conflict Resolution Improvements

* MergePolicy.NONE is now the default merge-policy
* Conflict Resolution during a merge is now non-blocking and tolerant of
node failures

Reactive Streams based Cache Loader SPI available

Infinispan can now be built and tested with Java 10/11

Max Idle expiration is now cluster-wide including events

The Java Hot Rod client can handle data in multiple formats

Improved merge _after_ long GC pauses avoiding data loss

Admin console supports counters in standalone mode

Lots of bug fixes, test fixes, and documentation improvements

As usual, you can find all the bits on
our http://infinispan.org/download/[website]. If you find any issues,
don't hesitate to report them on
our https://issues.jboss.org/projects/ISPN[issue tracker.]

Enjoy,
The Infinispan Team
