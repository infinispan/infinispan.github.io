extremely pleased to announce that Infinispan 5.1.0.FINAL 'Brahma' is
out now! It comes with some very important brand new features such as:

forum users, which have been giving us tremendous feedback, occasional
community contributors and core developers. Thank you very much for all
the effort you've put in!!
