Last month I presented about building functional reactive applications
with Infinispan, Node.js and Elm at both Soft-Shake in Geneva
(https://speakerdeck.com/galderz/learn-how-to-build-functional-reactive-applications-with-elm-node-dot-js-and-infinispan[slides])
and Devoxx Morocco
(https://speakerdeck.com/galderz/learn-how-to-build-functional-reactive-applications-with-elm-node-dot-js-and-infinispan-1[slides]).



Thanks a lot to all the participants who attended the talks and thanks
also to the organisers for accepting my talk. Both conferences were
really enjoyable!



At Soft-Shake I managed to attend a few presentations, and the one that
really stuck with me was the one from Alexandre Masselot on
http://www.kora.li/admin.html#/index/p?u=alex_masselot&s=tribulations_CFF&c=softshake&e=Donkey_Kong["Données
CFF en temps réel: tribulations techniques dans la stack Big
Data"] (http://www.slideshare.net/alexmass/swiss-transport-in-real-time-tribulations-in-the-big-data-stack[slides]).
It was a very interesting use case on doing big data with the
information from the Swiss Rail system. Although there was no live demo,
Alexandre gave the link to a repo where you can run stuff yourself. Very
cool!



On top of that, I also attended a talk by Tom Bujok on Scaling Your
Application Out. Tom happens to be an old friend who since I last met
him has joined Hazelcast ;)

Shortly after Shoft-Shake I headed to Casablanca to speak at Devoxx
Morocco. This was a fantastic conference with a lot of young attendees.
The room was almost packed up for my talk and I got good reaction from
the audience on both the talk and the live demo.



During the conference I also attended other talks, including a couple of
Kubernetes talks by Ray Tsang, who is an Infinispan committer himself.
In his presentations he uses a
https://github.com/saturnism/gcp-live-k8s-visualizer[Kubernetes
visualizer] which is very cool and I'm hoping to use it in future
presentations :)



No more conferences for this year, thanks to all who've attended
Infinispan presentations throughout the year!



Cheers,

Galder
