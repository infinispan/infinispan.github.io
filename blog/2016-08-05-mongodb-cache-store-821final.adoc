In the storm of the persistence SPI rework that happened during
Infinispan 6.0, the MongoDB cache store, among others, was left in a
state of semi-abandonment for a long time.

Fortunately a few brave souls came to its rescue and have breathed new
life into it so that it can be used with Infinispan 8.x

In particular I wish to thank Kurt Lehrke for doing most of the work
!!!
