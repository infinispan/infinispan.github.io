We've just released Infinispan 7.2.0.Beta2 which adds better support for
determining which configuration options have been defined by the user
versus those options that contain default values. This is an important
stepping stone in our aim to enable partial configuration overlays and
proper configuration template support.



On top of that, we've added the capability for Java Hot Rod clients to
https://issues.jboss.org/browse/ISPN-5283[recover from full cluster
restarts] and fixed an
https://issues.jboss.org/browse/ISPN-5208[important topology transfer
bug that lead to ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException exceptions] when
applying topology changes.



Finally, in order to provide better out-of-the-box experience with Near
Caches in Java Hot Rod client, we have made mandatory to define the
maximum number of entries Near Caches should have. Previously, Near
Caches were configured to be unbounded by default which would have
resulted in memory leaks unless the client removed them by calling
RemoteCache.remove() or similar. A configuration exceptions is reported
now if no maximum size has been defined in the Java Hot Rod client, but
the user can still provide a 0 or negative value to indicate the Near
Caches should be unbounded.
