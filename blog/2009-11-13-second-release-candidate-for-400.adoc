Hi all

I'm pleased to announce a second release candidate for Infinispan 4.0.0.
CR2 builds on CR1, fixing a whole pile of issues reported - thanks for
the feedback, everyone! In addition, we have started benchmarking and
profiling Infinispan using the
http://cachebenchfwk.sourceforge.net/[CacheBenchFwk] project, and based
on our findings have tweaked and tuned things accordingly. We will
publish results of these tests soon.

This release also brings along another tech preview - the
http://lucene.apache.org/[Lucene] Directory Provider, courtesy of
http://code.google.com/soc/[Google Summer of Code] student
http://www.jboss.org/community/people/lmoren[Lukasz Moren] and frequent
contributor http://www.jboss.org/community/people/sannegrinovero[Sanne
Grinovero]. Excellent work, guys, finally a distributed, in-memory store
for Lucene indexes! This provider is bundled in the Infinispan distro,
as is a demo showing off the capabilities of such a directory provider.
More details on

wiki page].

notes report in JIRA].

As always, we need feedback, especially as close as we are to a final
release. http://www.jboss.org/community/people/sannegrinovero[Download]
