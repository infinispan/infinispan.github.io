Infinispan 5.2.0.ALPHA2 was released last Friday with several additions
for those that like to test Infinispan's bleeding edge capabilities. In
this case, it's out Map/Reduce functionality that's the star of the
show:

* https://issues.jboss.org/browse/ISPN-1665[A combiner can now be used
between the Map and Reduce phases]
* https://community.jboss.org/docs/DOC-18188[Reduce phase can now be
distributed]
* https://issues.jboss.org/browse/ISPN-2037[Map/Reduce now processes
entries in cache stores too]

Vladimir Blagojevic, one of our Infinispan developers, will be
explaining all about these features in a blog post coming right up, so
stay tuned! :)



Finally Adrian Nistor, the latest addition to the Infinispan team, has
been working on reducing the size of our distribution files by avoiding
duplication of jars.



Cheers,

Galder
