Besides other cool features such as Map reduce and distributed
executors, Infinispan 5.0.0 "Pagoa" brings some significant improvements
around transactional functionality:

* https://docs.jboss.org/author/x/BIF7[transaction recovery]
http://community.jboss.org/docs/DOC-16646?uniqueTitle=false[] is now
supported, with a set of tools that allow state reconciliation in case
the transaction fails during 2nd phase of 2PC. This is especially useful
in the case of transactions spreading over Infinispan and another
resource manager, e.g. a database (distributed transactions). You can
find out more on how to enable and use transaction recovery
https://docs.jboss.org/author/x/BIF7[here].
* http://download.oracle.com/javaee/1.3/api/javax/transaction/Synchronization.html[Synchronization]
enlistment is another important feature in this release. This allows
Infinispan to enlist in a transaction as an
http://download.oracle.com/javaee/1.3/api/javax/transaction/Synchronization.html[Synchronization]
rather than an
http://download.oracle.com/javaee/1.3/api/javax/transaction/xa/XAResource.html[XAResource].This
enlistment allows the TransactionManager to optimize 2PC with a 1PC
where only one other resource is enlisted with that transaction
(http://docs.redhat.com/docs/en-US/JBoss_Enterprise_Web_Platform/5/html/Administration_And_Configuration_Guide/ch09s04.html[last
resource commit optimization]). This is particularly important when
using Infinispan as a 2nd level cache in Hibernate. You can read more
about this feature https://docs.jboss.org/author/x/_YB7[here].
* besides that several bugs were fixed particularly when it comes to the
integration with a transaction manager - BIG thanks to the community for
reporting and testing them!

To summarise, Infinispan can participate in a transaction in 3 ways:

. as a fully fledged XAResource that supports recovery
. as an XAResource, but without recovery. This is the default
configuration
. and as an Synchronization

In order to analyze the performance of running Infinispan in different
transactional modes I've
https://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/radargun/wiki/BenchmarkingTransactions[enhanced]
and used
http://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/radargun/wiki/WikiStart[Radargun]. The
diagram below shows a performance comparison between running Infinispan
in all the 3 modes described. The forth plot in the chart shows the
performance of running Infinispan without transactions - this gives an
idea about the cost of using transactions vs. raw operations.

The benchmark was run on
https://github.com/mmarkus/radargun/blob/blog_13Jun_2011/plugins/infinispan5/src/main/resources/benchmark/benchmark-tx.xml[this]
Radargun configuration, using Infinispan 5.0.0.CR5 configured as shown
https://github.com/mmarkus/radargun/blob/blog_13Jun_2011/plugins/infinispan5/src/main/resources/dist-tx-sync-commit.xml[here].
As a TransactionManager
https://github.com/mmarkus/radargun/blob/blog_13Jun_2011/plugins/infinispan5/pom.xml#L38[JBossTS
4.15.0.FINAL] was used, configured with a VolatileStore as shown
https://github.com/mmarkus/radargun/blob/blog_13Jun_2011/plugins/infinispan5/src/main/java/org/radargun/infinispan/JBossTMLookup.java[here].
Each node was an http://ark.intel.com/Product.aspx?id=47923[4-core
Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5640 @ 2.67GHz], with 4GB RAM.

Each transaction spread over only one put operation. The chart shows the
following:

* a non-transactional put is about 40% faster than a transactional one
* http://download.oracle.com/javaee/1.3/api/javax/transaction/Synchronization.html[Synchronization]-enlisted
transactions outperform an
http://download.oracle.com/javaee/1.3/api/javax/transaction/xa/XAResource.html[XAResource]
enlisted one by about 20%
* A recoverable cache has about the same performance as a
non-recoverable cache when it comes to transactions.

And that's not all! During Infinispan 5.0.0 development we've been
thinking a lot about how we can improve transactional throughput,
especially in scenarios in which multiple transactions are writing on
the same key. As a result we've come up with some improvement
suggestions summarised
