Dear Infinispan Community,




We are happy to announce the second Beta release of Infinispan 8.0.0!

This release brings many improvements and fixes:

* Distributed Stream support
(https://issues.jboss.org/browse/ISPN-5293[ISPN-5293]) - Support for
distributed java.util.stream.Stream operations allowing for efficient
remote aggregations and others (a detailed blog post will follow).

* Grouping and aggregations with DSL based queries
(https://issues.jboss.org/browse/ISPN-5416[ISPN-5416]).

* Log4J 2.x support (which people have been demanding for a long time).

* The Server is now based upon WildFly 9.

* Improvements in the Remote Iterator that will benefit the upcoming
Apache Spark connector.

* Development on our web based admin console continues as planned. We
have added cache configuration viewers, updated live cache statistics as
well as an ability to create caches from the admin console. Stay tuned
for latest developments on our admin console project at
