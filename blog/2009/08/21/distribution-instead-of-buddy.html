<p>People have often commented on
<a href="http://www.jboss.org/community/wiki/JBossCacheBuddyReplication">Buddy
Replication</a> (from <a href="http://www.jboss.org/jbosscache">JBoss Cache</a>) not
being available in Infinispan, and have asked how Infinispan&#8217;s far
superior <a href="http://www.jboss.org/community/docs/DOC-10278">distribution</a>
mode works. I&#8217;ve decided to write this article to discuss the main
differences from a high level. For deeper technical details, please
visit the <a href="http://www.jboss.org/community/wiki/Infinispan">Infinispan
wiki</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Scalability versus high availability
These two concepts are often at odds with one another, even though they
are commonly lumped together. What is usually good for scalability isn&#8217;t
always good for high availability, and vice versa. When it comes to
clustering servers, high availability often means simply maintaining
more copies, so that if nodes fail - and with commodity hardware, this
is expected - state is not lost. An extreme case of this is replicated
mode, available in both JBoss Cache and Infinispan, where each node is a
clone of its neighbour. This provides very high availability, but
unfortunately, this does not scale well. Assume you have 2GB per node.
Discounting overhead, with replicated mode, you can only address 2GB of
space, regardless of how large the cluster is. Even if you had 100 nodes
- seemingly 200GB of space! - you&#8217;d still only be able to address 2GB
since each node maintains a redundant copy. Further, since every node
needs a copy, a lot of network traffic is generated as the cluster size
grows.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Enter Buddy Replication
Buddy Replication (BR) was originally devised as a solution to this
scalability problem. BR does not replicate state to every other node in
the cluster. Instead, it chooses a fixed number of 'backup' nodes and
only replicates to these backups. The number of backups is configurable,
but in general it means that the number of backups is fixed. BR improved
scalability significantly and showed near-linear scalability with
increasing cluster size. This means that as more nodes are added to a
cluster, the space available grows linearly as does the available
computing power if measured in transactions per second.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But Buddy Replication doesn&#8217;t help everybody!
BR was specifically designed around the HTTP session caching use-case
for the JBoss Application Server, and heavily optimised accordingly. As
a result, session affinity is mandated, and applications that do not use
session affinity can be prone to a lot of data gravitation and
'thrashing' - data is moved back and forth across a cluster as different
nodes attempt to claim 'ownership' of state. Of course this is not a
problem with JBoss AS and HTTP session caching - session affinity is
recommended, available on most load balancer hardware and/or software,
is taken for granted, and is a well-understood and employed paradigm for
web-based applications.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So we had to get better
Just solving the HTTP session caching use-case wasn&#8217;t enough. A
well-performing data grid needs to to better, and crucially, session
affinity cannot be taken for granted. And this was the primary reason
for not porting BR to Infinispan. As such, Infinispan does not and will
not support BR as it is too restrictive.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Distribution
Distribution is a new cache mode in Infinispan. It is also the default
clustered mode - as opposed to replication, which isn&#8217;t scalable.
Distribution makes use of familiar concepts in data grids, such as
<a href="http://www.spiteful.com/2008/03/17/programmers-toolbox-part-3-consistent-hashing/">consistent
hashing</a>, call proxying and local caching of remote lookups. What this
leads to is a design that does scale well - fixed number of replicas for
each cache entry, just like BR - but no requirement for session
affinity.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>What about co-locating state?
Co-location of state - moving entries about as a single block - was
automatic and implicit with BR. Since each node always picked a backup
node for all its state, one could visualize all of the state on a given
node as a single block. Thus, colocation was trivial and automatic:
whatever you put in Node1 will always be together, even if Node1
eventually dies and the state is accessed on Node2. However, this meant
that state cannot be evenly balanced across a cluster since the data
blocks are very coarse grained.
With distribution, colocation is not implicit. In part due to the use of
consistent hashing to determine where each cached entry resides, and
also in part due to the finer-grained cache structure of Infinispan -
key/value pairs instead of a tree-structure - this leads to individual
entries as the granularity of state blocks. This means nodes can be far
better balanced across a cluster. However, it does mean that certain
optimizations which rely on co-location - such as keeping related
entries close together - is a little more tricky.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>One approach to co-locate state would be to use containers as values.
For example, put all entries that should be colocated together into a
HashMap. Then store the HashMap in the cache. But that is coarse-grained
and ugly as an approach, and will mean that the entire HashMap would
need to be locked and serialized as a single atomic unit, which can be
expensive if this map is large.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Another approach is to use Infinispan&#8217;s
<a href="http://infinispan.sourceforge.net/4.0/apidocs/org/infinispan/atomic/AtomicMap.html">AtomicMap</a>
API. This powerful API lets you group entries together, so they will
always be colocated, locked together, but replication will be much
finer-grained, allowing only deltas to the map to be replicated. So that
makes replication fast and performant, but it still means everything is
locked as a single atomic unit. While this is necessary for certain
applications, it isn&#8217;t always be desirable.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>One more solution is to implement your own
<a href="http://infinispan.sourceforge.net/4.0/apidocs/org/infinispan/distribution/ConsistentHash.html">ConsistentHash</a>
algorithm - perhaps extending DefaultConsistentHash. This implementation
would have knowledge of your object model, and hashes related instances
such that they are located together in the hash space. By far the most
complex mechanism, but if performance and co-location really is a hard
requirement then you cannot get better than this approach.</p>
