Last week the first ever Snowcamp was held in Grenoble where I presented
about
https://snowcamp2016.sched.org/event/5meE/distributed-data-processing-with-infinispan-and-java-streams["Distributed
Data Processing with Infinispan and Java Streams"].

The conference was very enjoyable with multiple tracks focused on Big
Data, web technologies (with a big emphasis on Javascript), devops, and
software development. Emmanuel, Mickael and the rest of the team did an
awesome job at organising the conference in record time with very good
attendance numbers :)

The talk went well and fortunately the demo gods were with me that day
:). The code of the demo can be found in
https://github.com/galderz/distributed-streams[this Github repository].
The slides will be available soon.

Of the presentations I attended, I was particularly impressed with the
https://snowcamp2016.sched.org/event/5nBW/introduction-a-apache-zeppelin[Apache
Zeppelin talk] that Saad Ansari presented where he demonstrated how to
do interactive data analysis on top of Apache Spark, very cool!

It was a pleasure being selected to talk at Snowcamp and hope that next
year I can speak there too!

Cheers,
Galder
