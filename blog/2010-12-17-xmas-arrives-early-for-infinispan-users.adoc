Just in time for Christmas, the first release in the 5.x series called
5.0.0.ALPHA1 is out. This release implements one of the most demanded
features which is the ability to store non-Serializable objects into
Infinispan data grids! You can now do so thanks to the ability to plug
Infinispan with Externalizer implementations that know how to
marshall/unmarshall a particular type. To find out more on how to
implement this Externalizers and how to plug them, check
http://community.jboss.org/docs/DOC-16198[the following article that
explain this in great detail].



A very important benefit of using Infinispan's Externalizer framework is
that user classes now benefit from a lightning fast marshalling
framework based on http://www.jboss.org/jbossmarshalling[JBoss
Marshalling]. Back in the 4.0.0 days when we switched from JDK
serialization to JBoss Marshalling, we saw a performance improvement of
around 10-15% and we're confident that 5.x user applications will see a
similar performance increase once they start providing Externalizer
implementations for their own types.



At this stage, it's very important that Infinispan users have a go at
implementing their own Externalizer implementations so that we have
enough time to make adjustments based on feedback provided. Your input
is crucial!!



Staying with the marshalling topic, another novelty included in this
release is http://community.jboss.org/docs/DOC-15774[the ability to plug
Hot Rod clients with portable serialization thanks to Apache Avro]. This
is not tremendously important right now, but once Hot Rod protocol
clients have been written in other languages, they'd be able to
seamlessly share data even if they're written in different languages! In
case you're not aware, a Python Hot Rod client is already in the
making...



Finally, details of all issues fixed can be found

Enjoy and Merry Christmas to all :)
