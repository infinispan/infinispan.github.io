We're now back from JFokus and we'd like to thank organizers, attendees,
volunteers and sponsors for making JFokus a very enjoyable experience!
:)

From an Infinispan perspective, we started the week with a Streaming
Data deep-dive session presented together with Clement Escoffier. This
was a 3h long session, so there was plenty to go through but we managed
to do it on time. The final demo did not fully work, but this is
something we will improving it in the near future. Slides can be found
in [http://bit.ly/streaming-data-dd-1[1]]

http://bit.ly/streaming-data-dd-code[here]. This session was not
recorded.

Next day I had a talk on streaming data analysis on top of Kubernetes
where I went through some of the topics explained in the deep dive. This
was mostly a live coding session showing how to work with streaming data
on top OpenShift/Kubernetes which run on Google Cloud. This session was
recorded. I'll keep an eye for when the video becomes available to share
it here. The code from this session can be found

instructions http://bit.ly/sdk8s-jfokus18-lc[here].

The rest of the conference was a blast, with many networking
opportunities. During this networking I started working on an RxJava2
API facade for Infinispan remote API, which would make it easier to fit
with other reactive toolkits out there, such as Vert.x :). More news on
this soon

Cheers,
Galder
