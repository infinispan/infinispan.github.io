The latest Infinispan 5.2.0.CR2 release includes a set of modules for
JBoss AS 7.x. By installing these modules, it is possible to deploy user
applications without packaging the Infinispan JARs within the
deployments (WARs, EARs, etc), thus minimizing their size. In order not
to conflict with the Infinispan modules which are already present within
an AS installation, the modules provided by the Infinispan distribution
are located within their own slot identified by the _major.minor_
versions (e.g. slot="5.2").

within our application, we need to add explicit dependencies to the
deployment's MANIFEST:

If you are using Maven to generate your artifacts, mark the Infinispan
dependencies as _provided_ and configure your artifact archiver to
generate the appropriate MANIFEST.MF file:
