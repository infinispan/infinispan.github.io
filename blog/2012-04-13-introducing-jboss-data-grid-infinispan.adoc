To many who are familiar with http://www.redhat.com/[Red Hat]'s model of
unsupported upstream projects with supported, heavily tested and
certified controlled-release "products", the announcement of the JBoss
Data Grid (JDG) will come as no surprise.  JDG is to
http://www.infinispan.org/[Infinispan] what
http://www.redhat.com/products/enterprise-linux/[Red Hat Enterprise
Linux] is to http://fedoraproject.org/[Fedora], or what
http://www.redhat.com/products/jbossenterprisemiddleware/application-platform/[JBoss
Enterprise Application Platform] (EAP) is to
http://www.jboss.org/jbossas[JBoss AS].  Folks considering deploying
Infinispan in a mission-critical production environment should consider
JDG instead, not only to gain the benefits of a more thorough quality
control and certification process but also to allow Red Hat to provide
development and production support and consultancy.

JDG was announced at Red Hat Summit/JBoss World last year, and
http://infinispan.blogspot.co.uk/2011/05/red-hat-announces-enterprise-data-grid.html[I
blogged about it] here, and now JDG has reached a stage where it is
http://www.redhat.com/promo/dg6beta/[available as a public beta] with a
GA release coming soon.  If you are interested in JDG, or supportable
Infinispan, I encourage you to register your interest in the
http://www.redhat.com/promo/dg6beta/[JDG Beta].

Enjoy
