The first ever http://www.jboss.org/events/JUDCon/2013/brazil/[JUDCon
Brazil] was held a couple of weeks back and it was a real blast!
Firstly, it offered a great opportunity to meet some members of the
JBoss community which have been helping us push JBoss projects forward
in this region of the world, such as
https://twitter.com/hannelita[Hanneli Tavante],
http://www.linkedin.com/in/wrsantos[Roberto dos Santos Wagner], ...etc.
It was great sharing ideas, experiences...etc with them and coming up
with new ideas!

As mentioned before in the post before the conference, I had two new
presentations to deliver, one on JSR-107 specification on JCache API and
Infinispan's implementation, and the other on Hibernate Second Level
Cache with Infinispan. The JCache presentation went really well and all
the live coding worked as expected.

The second presentation was the busier of the two, with a full room
packed with Hibernate/JPA users waiting to hear how to scale up their
applications. I got excellent feedback from both presentations and
looking forward to giving these presentations in more user groups or
conferences.

The presentations are not up yet, but I expect them to be posted online
in the next few weeks. In the mean time, here are a couple of temporary
links to the PDFs of my presentations:


* Bolttlenecks are out! Java Cache Standard (JSR-107) is in!

* Scaling up Hibernate/JPA applications with Infinispan second-level
cache

The big news of the conference was for sure the announcement of JBoss
Application Servers' new name: http://wildfly.org/[WildFly]. We're
actively working with them to make the most out of Infinispan :)

Cheers,
Galder
