We've just come back from our trip to Spain and first of all, we'd like
to thank everyone who attended our talks and workshops at
https://twitter.com/madridjug[Madrid Java User Group] and
https://2017.codemotion.es/[Codemotion Madrid] as well organisers and
sponsors who made it possible!

We had a very hectic schedule, which started with a Red Hat double bill
for Madrid JUG. Thomas Segismont started the evening with Vert.x talk
and Galder followed up with a talk on how to do data analytics using
Infinispan-based data grids.

In the data analytics talk, Galder focused on how to use distributed
Java Streams to do analytics and also showed how to use Infinispan Spark
connector when Java Streams are not enough. The distributed Java Streams
demo he ran can be found
https://github.com/infinispan-demos/swiss-transport-datagrid/tree/codemotion-madrid-17[here].
The most relevant files of that demo are:

* https://github.com/infinispan-demos/swiss-transport-datagrid/blob/codemotion-madrid-17/live-events/madridjug17.md[Live
coding instructions], follow them to do the same steps he did in the
talk.
* https://github.com/infinispan-demos/swiss-transport-datagrid/blob/codemotion-madrid-17/analytics/analytics-server/src/main/solution/delays/java/stream/task/DelayRatioTask.java[Server
task solution class] using distributed Java Streams.

Galder also demonstrated how to use Infinispan Spark connector by
showing the
https://github.com/infinispan/infinispan-spark/tree/master/examples/twitter[Twitter
example]. The slides from this talk (in Spanish) can be found
https://speakerdeck.com/galderz/data-grids-descubre-que-esconden-los-datos[here]:



Next day on Friday, Galder gave a talk at Codemotion Madrid on working
with streaming data with Infinispan, Vert.x and OpenShift. For the first
time he was running it all on top of Google Cloud, so he could finally
free up my laptop from running the demos and take advantage of the power
of a cloud provider!

The demo can be found
https://github.com/infinispan-demos/streaming-data-kubernetes/tree/codemotion-madrid-17[here]
where you can also find instructions on how to run it on top of Google
Cloud. If you want to follow the same steps he followed during the talk,
live coding instructions are

The slides from this talk (in Spanish) can be found

Finally on Saturday we delivered the
https://github.com/infinispan-demos/streaming-data-workshop[Streaming
Data workshop] at Codemotion Madrid. Once again, basing our workshop on
top of Virtual Box still caused us some issues, but people managed to
get through it. We have some plans for next year to avoid the need of
Virtual Box, stay tuned!

This trip to Madrid wraps up a very intense year in terms of promoting
Infinispan! Next month we'll be doing a recap of the talks, videos...etc
so that you can catch up with them in case you missed any of them :)



Katia & Galder
Un saludo!
