Deadlock detection is a new feature in Infinispan. It is about
increasing the number of transactions that can be concurrently
processed. Let's start with the problem first (the deadlock) then
discuss some design details and performance.

So, the by-the-book deadlock example is the following:

* Transaction one (T1) performs following operation sequence: (write
key_1,write key_2)

* Transaction two (T2) performs following sequence: (write key_2, write
key_1).

Now, if the T1 and T2 happen at the same time and both have executed
first operation, then they will wait for each other virtually forever to
release owned locks on keys. In the real world, the waiting period is
defined by a lock acquisition timeout (LAT) - which defaults to 10
seconds - that allows the system to overcome such scenarios and respond
to the user one way (successful) or the other(failure): so after a
period of LAT one (or both) transaction will rollback, allowing the
other to continue working.

Deadlocks are bad for both system's throughput and user experience.
System throughput is affected because during the deadlock period (which
might extend up to LAT) no other thread will be able to update neither
key_1 nor key_2. Even worse, access to any other keys that were modified
by T1 or T2 will be similarly restricted. User experience is altered by
the fact that the call(s) will freeze for the entire deadlock period,
and also there's a chance that both T1 and T2 will rollback by timing
out.

As a side note, in the previous example, if the code running the
transactions would(and can) enforce any sort of ordering on the keys
accessed within the transaction, then the deadlock would be avoided.
E.g. if the application code would order the operation based on the
lexicographic ordering of keys, both T1 and T2 would execute the
following sequence: (write key_1,write key_2), and so no deadlock would
result. This is a best practice and should be followed whenever
possible.
Enough with the theory! The way Infinispan performs deadlock detection
is based on an algorithm designed by
http://www.jboss.org/community/people/jason.greene%40jboss.com[Jason
Greene] and
http://www.jboss.org/community/people/manik.surtani%40jboss.com[Manik
Surtani], which is detailed
http://www.jboss.org/index.html?module=bb&op=viewtopic&p=4244838#4244838[here].
The basic idea is to split the LAT in smaller cycles, as it follows:

[source,java]
----
lock(int lockAcquisitionTimeout) {
while (currentTime < startTime + timeout) {
 if (acquire(smallTimeout)) break;
 testForDeadlock(globalTransaction, key);
}
}
----


What testForDeadlock(globalTransaction, key) does is check weather there
is another transaction that satisfies both conditions:

. holds a lock on key and
. intends to lock on a key that is currently called by this
transaction.

If such a transaction is found then this is a deadlock, and one of the
running transactions will be interrupted: the decision of which
transaction will interrupt is based on coin toss, a random number that
is associated with each transaction. This will ensure that only one
transaction will rollback, and the decision is deterministic: nodes and
transactions do not need to communicate with each other to determine the
outcome.

Deadlock detection in Infinispan works in two flavors: determining
deadlocks on transactions that spread over several caches and deadlock
detection in transactions running on a single(local) cache.

Let's see some performance figures as well. A class for benchmarking
performance of deadlock detection functionality was created and can be
seen
http://viewvc.jboss.org/cgi-bin/viewvc.cgi/infinispan/trunk/core/src/test/java/org/infinispan/profiling/DeadlockDetectionPerformanceTest.java?view=markup[here].
Test description (from javadoc):

__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

We use a fixed size pool of keys (KEY_POOL_SIZE) on which each
transaction operates. A number of threads (THREAD_COUNT) repeatedly
starts transactions and tries to acquire locks on a random subset of
this pool, by executing put operations on each key. If all locks were
successfully acquired then the tx tries to commit: only if it succeeds
this tx is counted as successful. The number of elements in this subset
is the transaction size (TX_SIZE). The greater transaction size is, the
higher chance for deadlock situation to occur. On each thread these
transactions are being repeatedly executed (each time on a different,
random key set) for a given time interval (BENCHMARK_DURATION). At the
end, the number of successful transactions from each thread is
cumulated, and this defines throughput (successful tx) per time unit (by
default one minute).

Disclaimer: The following figures are for a scenario especially designed
to force very high contention. This is not typical, and you shouldn't
expect to see this level of increase in performance for applications
with lower contention (which most likely is the case). Please feel free
tune the above benchmark class to fit the contention level of your
application; sharing your experience would be very useful!

Following diagram shows the performance degradation resulting from
running the deadlock detection code by itslef in a scenario where no
contention/deadlocks are present.

Some clues on when to enable deadlock detection. A high number of
transaction rolling back due to
org.infinispan.util.concurrent.TimeoutException is an indicator that
this functionality might help. TimeoutException might be caused by other
causes as well, but deadlocks will always result in this exception being
thrown. Generally, when you have a high contention on a set of keys,
deadlock detection may help. But the best way is not to guess the
performance improvement but to benchmark and monitor it: you can have
access to statistics (e.g. number of deadlocks detected) through JMX, as
it is exposed via the DeadlockDetectingLockManager MBean.
