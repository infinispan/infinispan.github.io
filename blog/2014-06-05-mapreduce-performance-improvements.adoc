== Introduction


There have been a number of recent Infinispan 7.0 Map/Reduce performance
related https://issues.jboss.org/browse/ISPN-4241?filter=12321790[improvements] that
we were eager to test in our performance lab and subsequently share with
you. The results are more than promising. In the word count use case,
Map/Reduce task execution speed and throughput improvement is between
fourfold and sixfold in certain situations that were tested.

We have achieved these improvements by focusing on:

* Optimized mapper/reducer parallel execution on all nodes
* Improving the handling and processing of larger data sets
* Reducing the amount of memory needed for execution of MapReduceTask



== Performance Test Results


The performance tests were run using the following parameters:

* An Infinispan 7.0.0-SNAPSHOT build created after the last commits from
the list were committed to the Infinispan GIT repo on May 9th vs
Infinispan 6.0.1.Final 
* OpenJDK version 1.7.0_55 with 4GB of heap and the following JVM
options:

* Random data filled 30% of the Java heap, and 100 random words were
used to create the 8 kilobyte cache values. The cache keys were
generated using key affinity, so that the generated data would be
distributed evenly in the cache. These values were chosen, so that a
comparison to Infinispan 6 could be made. Infinispan 7 can handle a
final result map with a much larger set of keys than is possible in
Infinispan 6. The actual amount of heap size that is used for data will
be larger due to backup copies, since the cluster is running in
distributed mode.
* The MapReduceTask executes a word count against the cache values
using https://github.com/infinispan/infinispan/blob/master/demos/distexec/src/main/java/org/infinispan/demo/mapreduce/WordCountMapperEmitPerValue.java[mapper],
https://github.com/infinispan/infinispan/blob/master/demos/distexec/src/main/java/org/infinispan/demo/mapreduce/WordCountReducer.java[reducer,
combiner], and
https://github.com/infinispan/infinispan/blob/master/demos/distexec/src/main/java/org/infinispan/demo/mapreduce/WordCountCollator.java[collator] implementations.
The collator returns the 10 most frequently occurring words in the cache
data. The task used a distributed reduce phase and a shared intermediate
cache. The MapReduceTask is executed 10 times against the data in the
cache and the values are reported as an average of these durations.



=== From 1 to 8 nodes using a fixed amount of data and 30% of the heap


This test executes two word count executions on each cluster with an
increasing number of nodes. The first execution uses an increasing
amount of data equal to 30% of the total Java heap across the
cluster (i.e. With one node, the data consumes 30% of 4 GB. With two
nodes, the data consumes 30% of 8 GB, etc.), and the second execution
uses a fixed amount of data, (1352 MB which is approximately 30% of 4
GB). Throughput is calculated by dividing the total amount of data
processed by the Map/Reduce task by the duration. The following charts
show the throughput as nodes are added to the cluster for these two
scenarios:

http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-pCrAYjE-GF4/U5ApZ1CkjXI/AAAAAAAAABs/5FNXfsU-eBc/s1600/ISPN_7_fixed_size_and_30%25_throughput.png[image:http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-pCrAYjE-GF4/U5ApZ1CkjXI/AAAAAAAAABs/5FNXfsU-eBc/s1600/ISPN_7_fixed_size_and_30%25_throughput.png[image]]

These charts clearly show the increase in throughput that were made in
Infinispan 7. The throughput also seems to scale in an almost linear
fashion for this word count scenario. With one node, Infinispan 7
processes the 30% of heap data in about 100 MB/sec, two nodes process
almost 200 MB/sec, and 8 nodes process over 700 MB/sec.


=== From 1 to 8 nodes using different heap size percentages


This test executes the word count task using different percentages of
heap size as nodes are added to the cluster. (5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%,
and 30%) Here are the throughput results for this test:

Once again, these charts show an increase in throughput when performing
the same word count task using Infinispan 7. The chart for Infinispan 7
shows more fluctuation in the throughput across the different
percentages of heap size. The throughput plotted in the Infinispan 6
chart is more consistent.


=== From 1 to 8 nodes using different value sizes


This test executes the word count task using 30% of the heap size and
different cache value sizes as nodes are added to the cluster. (1KB,
2KB, 4KB, 8KB, 16KB, 32KB, 64KB, 128KB, 256KB, 512KB, 1MB, and 2MB) Here
are the throughput results for this test:

These results are more interesting. The throughput in Infinispan 7 is
higher for certain cache size values, but closer to Infinispan 6 or even
slower for other cache size values. The throughput peaks for 32KB cache
values, but can be much lower for larger and smaller values. Smaller
values require more overhead, but for larger values this behavior is not
expected. This result needs to be investigated more closely.


== Conclusion


The performance tests show that Infinispan 7 Map/Reduce improvements
have increased the throughput and execution speed four to sixfold in
some use cases. The changes have also allowed Infinispan 7 to process
data sets that include larger intermediate results and produce larger
final result maps. There are still areas of the Map/Reduce algorithm
that need to be improved:

* The Map/Reduce algorithm should be self-tuning.
The https://github.com/infinispan/infinispan/blob/master/core/src/main/java/org/infinispan/distexec/mapreduce/MapReduceTask.java#L400[maxCollectorSize] parameter
controls the number of values that the collector holds in memory, and it
is not trivial to determine the optimal value for a given scenario. The
value is based on the size of the values in the cache and the size of
the intermediate results. A user is likely to know the size of the cache
values, but currently
https://issues.jboss.org/browse/ISPN-4318[Infinispan does not report
statistics] about the intermediate results to the user. The Map/Reduce
algorithm should analyze the environment at runtime and adjust the size
of the collector dynamically.
* The fact that the throughput results vary with different value sizes
needs to be investigated more closely. This could be due to the fact
that the maxCollectorSize value used for these tests is not ideal for
all value sizes, but there might be other causes for this behaviour.
