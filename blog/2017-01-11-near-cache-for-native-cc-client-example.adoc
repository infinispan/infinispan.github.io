Dear Readers,

as mentioned in our previous post about the new C++/C# release
http://blog.infinispan.org/2017/01/hotrod-clients-cc-810beta1-released.html[8.1.0.Beta1],
clients are now equipped with near cache support.

The near cache is an additional cache level that keeps the most recently
used cache entries in an "in memory" data structure. Near cached objects
are synchronized with the remote server value in the background and can
be get as fast as a map[] operation.

So, your client tends to periodically focus the operations on a subset
of your entries? This feature could be of help: it's easy to use, just
enable it and you'll have near cache seamless under the wood.

A C++ example of a cache with near cache configuration

The last line does the magic, the INVALIDATED mode is the active mode
for the near cache (default mode is DISABLED which means no near cache,
see Java docs), maxEntries is the maximum number of entries that can be
stored nearly. If the near cache is full the oldest entry will be
evicted. Set maxEntries=0 for unbounded cache (do you have enough
memory?)
Now a full example of application that just does some gets and puts and
counts how many of them are served remote and how many are served
nearly. As you can see the cache object is an instance of the "well
known" RemoteCache class

Entries values in the near cache are kept aligned with the remote cache
state via the events subsystem: if something changes in the server, an
update event (modified, expired, removed) is sent to the client that
updates the cache accordingly.

By the way: do you know that C++/C# clients can subscribe listener to
events? In the next "native" post we will see how.

Cheers!
and thank you for reading.
