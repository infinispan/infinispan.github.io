http://blog.softwhere.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/screenshot2.png[image:http://blog.softwhere.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/screenshot2.png[image]]I
will be presenting on Infinispan, data grids and the data fabric of
clouds at http://www.jbossworld.com/[JBoss World Chicago], in September
2009. I will cover a brief history of Infinispan and the motivations
behind the project, and then talk in a more abstract manner about data
grids and the special place they occupy in providing data services for
clouds.

In addition, I expect to pontificate on my thoughts on clouds and the
future of computing in general to anyone who buys me a coffee/beer!
:-)

So go on, http://www.jbossworld.com/boss/[convince your boss] to let you
go, and attend my talk, and hopefully I'll see you there!

Cheers
Manik
