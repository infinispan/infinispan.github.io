As we progress with the release of Infinispan 9.2 pre-releases, it's
important to highlight some of the more interesting improvements from an
end-user perspective.

As mentioned
http://blog.infinispan.org/2017/05/reactive-big-data-on-openshift-in.html[before],

Distributed Java Streams] can be used to calculate analytics over
existing data. Through overloading of methods, Infinispan is able to
offer a simple way of passing lambdas that are made to be Serializable
without the need of explicit casting. Being able to produce binary
formats for the lambdas is an important step for java streams executions
to be distributed. In this example, the cached values are being filtered
to find those that have a delay bigger than 0. This lambda can be safely
distributed without the need to cast to Serializable because
values().stream() returns org.infinispan.CacheStream that overloads
filter to take a SerializablePredicate:

Cache<String, Stop> cache = ...
cache.values().stream()
  .filter(e -> e.delayMin > 0);

However, there was one area which was still a bit clunky to use: Java
Collectors. When Java Streams came out, the JDK provided a class called
java.util.stream.Collectors which includes a lot of helper methods for
collecting results after stream processing. The problem with the
Collector instances returned by the helper methods is that they're not
Serializable.

Before Infinispan 9.2, we worked around this problem with the help
of org.infinispan.stream.CacheCollectors which defined
a serializableCollector method that took
a SerializableSupplier<Collector<T, ?, R>>. The aim here was this: even
if the Collector instance is not Serializable, the function that creates
the Collector can be made to be Serializable. It could be used this
way:

Cache<String, Stop> cache = ...
cache.values().stream().collect(
  CacheCollectors.serializableCollector(() -> Collectors.groupingBy(
      e -> getHourOfDay(e.departureTs),
      Collectors.counting()
)));

Although this worked, it was a clunky, so in Infinispan 9.2 we
overloaded collect() in org.infinispan.CacheStream to
take SerializableSupplier<Collector<T, ?, R>>. This means that in
Infinispan 9.2, the code above can be written like this instead:

Cache<String, Stop> cache = ...
cache.values().stream().collect(
  () -> Collectors.groupingBy(
      e -> getHourOfDay(e.departureTs),
      Collectors.counting()
));

This is a cleaner way of making sure Collector instances returned by
java.util.stream.Collectors can be distributed.
