title: Boost Application Performance
---

Infinispan turbocharges applications by storing data closer to processing logic, which reduces latency and increases throughput. 

Available as a Java library, you simply add Infinispan to your application dependencies and then youâ€™re ready to store data in the same memory space as the executing code.

If you want to provision a data layer that is independent of your applications, you can use Infinispan Server for remote access to data with in-memory performance. Clients are a single network hop away from data through consistent hashing techniques and can make requests over HTTP or with a custom binary TCP protocol called Hot Rod.
