Infinispan provides trusted open-source technology to deliver scalability to meet workload demands and reduce resource utilization. At the same time, Infinispan distributes your data across clusters so no single point of failure causes data loss.

One popular use for Infinispan is as a shared store for stateful data, such as user HTTP sessions. Applications can stay lightweight and avoid heap usage by externalizing sessions to Infinispan clusters, which act as an independent data layer.
