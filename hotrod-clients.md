### Hot Rod Clients

Hot Rod is a wire protocol that Infinispan clients use to talk to a remote grid. It is a binary, platform-independent protocol that was developed in the open as a part of Infinispan.

The Hot Rod [specification](https://infinispan.org/docs/stable/user_guide/user_guide.html#hot_rod_protocol) is available on-line, and several clients exist for this protocol.
