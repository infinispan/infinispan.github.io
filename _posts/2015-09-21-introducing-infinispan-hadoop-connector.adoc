The version 0.1 of the Infinispan Hadoop connector has just been made
available!

The connector will host several integrations with Hadoop related
projects, and in this first release it supports converting Infinispan
server into a Hadoop compliant data source, by providing an
implementation of InputFormat and OutputFormat.


==== The InfinispanInputFormat and InfinispanOutputFormat

====  

==== 

A Hadoop InputFormat is a specification of how a certain data source can
be partitioned and how to read data from each of the partitions.
Conversely, OutputFormat is used to write.

Looking closely at the Hadoop's InputFormat interface, we can see two
methods:

    List<InputSplit> getSplits(JobContext context);
 
    RecordReader<K,V> createRecordReader(InputSplit
split,TaskAttemptContext context);

The first method defines essentially a data partitioner, calculating one
or more InputSplits that contain information about a certain partition
of the data. With possession of a InputSplit, one can use it to obtain a
RecordReader to iterate over the data. These two operations allow for
parallelization of data processing across multiple nodes, and that's how
Hadoop map reduce achieves a high throughput over large datasets.

In Infinispan terms, each partition is a set of segments on a certain
server, and a record reader is a remote iterator over those segments.
The default partitioner shipped with the connector will create as many
partitions as servers in the cluster, and each partition will contain
the segments that are associated with that specific server.


==== Not only map reduce


Although the InfinispanInputFormat and InfinispanOutputformat can be
used to run traditional Hadoop map reduce jobs over Infinispan data, it
is not coupled to the Hadoop map reduce runtime. It is possible to
leverage the connector to integrate Infinispan with other tools that,
besides supporting Hadoop I/O interfaces, are able to read and write
data more efficiently. One of those tools is
https://flink.apache.org/[Apache Flink], that has a dataflow engine
capable of doing batch and stream data processing that supersedes the
classic two stage map reduce approach. 



==== Apache Flink example

====  

==== 

Apache Flink supports Hadoop's InputFormat as a data source to execute
batch jobs, so to integrate with Infinispan it's straightforward:




Please refer to the
https://github.com/infinispan/infinispan-hadoop/tree/master/samples/flink[complete
sample] that has docker images for both Apache Flink and Infinispan
server, and detailed instructions on how to execute and customise job.


==== Stay tuned


More details about the connector, maven coordinates, configuration
options, sources and samples can be found at the
https://github.com/infinispan/infinispan-hadoop[project repository]

In upcoming versions we expect to have a tighter integration with the
Hadoop platform in order to run Infinispan clusters as a YARN
application (https://issues.jboss.org/browse/ISPN-5709[ISPN-5709]), and
also support other tools from the ecosystem such as
https://pig.apache.org/[Apache Pig]
(https://issues.jboss.org/browse/ISPN-5749[ISPN-5749])
