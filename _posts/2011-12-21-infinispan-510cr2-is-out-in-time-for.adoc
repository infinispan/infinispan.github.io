Infinispan '_Brahma_' 5.1.0.CR2 is out now with a
https://issues.jboss.org/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?projectId=12310799&version=12318627[load
of fixes] and a few internal changes such the move to a StaX based XML
parser as opposed to relying on JAXB which did not get in for CR1. The
new parser is a lot faster and has less overhead and does not require
any changes from a user perspective.

We've also worked on improving startup time by indexing annotation
metadata at build time and reading it at runtime. From a Infinispan user
perspective, there's been some changes to how Infinispan is extended, in
particular related to https://docs.jboss.org/author/x/OQFT[custom
command implementations], where we know use
http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/ServiceLoader.html[JDK's
ServiceLoader] to load them.

As per usual, downloads are in the usual
http://www.jboss.org/infinispan/downloads[place], use the
http://community.jboss.org/en/infinispan?view=discussions[forums] to
provide feedback and report any issues.

Cheers, Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year to all the Infinispan
community! :)
