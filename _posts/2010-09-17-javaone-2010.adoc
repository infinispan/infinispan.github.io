So there's quite a lot going on at JavaOne 2010 - next week, already! -
with regards to Infinispan.  Firstly, I'm running a session and a BOF
both related to data grids and Infinispan.  Mark these in your
calendar!

The BOF is on Tuesday, at 21:00, titled
"http://www.eventreg.com/cc250/sessionDetail.jsp?SID=314196[A new era
for in-memory data grids]".  Click on the link for more details.

My main conference session is on Wednesday, at 13:00, titled
"http://www.eventreg.com/cc250/sessionDetail.jsp?SID=314192[Measuring
Performance and Looking for Bottlenecks in Java-Based Data Grids]".
 This should be a fun and interesting talk!

Further, the Red Hat/JBoss booth in the pavilion will be running a
series of "mini-sessions", with a chance to meet and interface with the
core R&D folk from JBoss including myself.  I'm running a mini-session
on building a _Data-as-a-Service (DaaS) grid using Infinispan_ on
Tuesday and Wednesday, along with similarly exciting talks by other Red
Hatters.  More details http://www.jboss.org/events/javaone.html[here].

And finally, the JBoss party.  JBoss parties at JavaOne have become
something of an institution and you sure wouldn't want to be left out!
 Details
http://www.jboss.org/events/javaone/javaone2010party.html[here], make
sure you get your invitations early as these always run out fast.

See you in San Francisco!

Cheers
