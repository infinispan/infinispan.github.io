is with great pleasure that I'd like to announce the availability of the
final release of http://www.infinispan.org/[Infinispan] 4.0.0.
Infinispan is an open source, Java-based data grid platform that I first
http://infinispan.blogspot.com/2009/04/infinispan-start-of-new-era-in-open.html[announced]
last April, and since then the codebase has been through a series of
alpha and beta releases, and most recently 4 release candidates which
generated a lot of community feedback.



It has been a long and wild ride, and the very active community has been
critical to this release. A big thank you to everyone involved, you all
know who you are.



*Benchmarks*

I
http://infinispan.blogspot.com/2010/02/infinispan-as-local-cache.html[recently
published] an article about running Infinispan in local mode - as a
standalone cache - compared to http://www.jboss.org/jbosscache/[JBoss
Cache] and http://ehcache.sourceforge.net/[EHCache]. The article took
readers through the ease of configuration and the simple API, and then
demonstrated some performance benchmarks using the recently-announced
http://infinispan.blogspot.com/2010/02/benchmarking-infinispan-and-other-data.html[Cache
Benchmarking Framework]. We've been making further use of this
benchmarking framework in the recent weeks and months, extensively
testing Infinispan on a large cluster.


Here are some simple charts, generated using the framework. The first
set compare Infinispan against the latest and greatest JBoss Cache
release (3.2.2.GA at this time), using both synchronous and asynchronous
replication. But first, a little bit about the nodes in our test lab,
comprising of a large number of nodes, each with the following
configuration:

* 2 x http://ark.intel.com/Product.aspx?id=37103[Intel Xeon E5530] 2.40
GHz quad core, hyperthreaded processors (= 16 hardware threads per node)
* 12GB memory per node, although the JVM heaps are limited at 2GB
* http://www.redhat.com/rhel/[RHEL] 5.4 with Sun 64-bit JDK 1.6.0_18
* http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/InfiniBand[InfiniBand] connectivity
between nodes

And a little bit about the way the benchmark framework was configured:

* Run from 2 to 12 nodes in increments of 2
* 25 worker threads per node
* Writing 1kb of state (randomly generated Strings) each time, with a
20% write percentage

|=======================================================================

As you can see, Infinispan significantly outperforms JBoss Cache, even
in replicated mode. The large gain in read performance, as well as
asynchronous write performance, demonstrates the minimally locking data
container and new marshalling techniques in Infinispan. But you also
notice that with synchronous writes, performance starts to degrade as
the cluster size increases. This is a characteristic of replicated
caches, where you always have fast reads and all state available on each
and every node, at the expense of ultimate scalability.



Enter Infinispan's distributed mode. The goal of data distribution is to
maintain enough copies of state in the cluster so it can be durable and
fault tolerant, but not too many copies to prevent Infinispan from being
scalable, with linear scalability being the ultimate prize. In the
following runs, we benchmark Infinispan's synchronous, distributed mode,
comparing 2 different Infinispan configurations. The framework was
configured with:

* Run from 4 to 48 nodes, in increments of 4 (to better demonstrate
linear scalability)
* 25 worker threads per node
* Writing 1kb of state (randomly generated Strings) each time, with a
20% write percentage

|=======================================================================




















As you can see, Infinispan scales linearly as the node count increases.
The different configurations tested, _lazy_ stands for enabling lazy
unmarshalling, which allows for state to be stored in Infinispan as byte
arrays rather than deserialized objects. This has certain advantages for
certain access patterns, for example where remote lookups are very
common and local lookups are rare.



How does Infinispan comparing against
$\{POPULAR_PROPRIETARY_DATAGRID_PRODUCT}?

Due to licensing restrictions on publishing benchmarks of such products,
we are unfortunately not at liberty to make such comparisons public -
although we are very pleased with how Infinispan compares against
popular commercial offerings, and plan to push the performance envelope
even further in 4.1.

And just because we cannot publish such results, that does not mean that
you cannot run such comparisons yourself. The Cache Benchmark Framework
has support for different data grid products, including
http://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/cachebenchfwk/wiki/CoherencePluginSetup[Oracle
Coherence], and more can be
http://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/cachebenchfwk/wiki/WritingCustomPlugins[added
easily].

Aren't statistics just lies?
We strongly recommend you running the benchmarks yourself. Not only does
this prove things for yourself, but also allows you to benchmark
behaviour on your specific hardware infrastructure, using the specific
configurations you'd use in real-life, and with your specific access
patterns.


*So where do I get it?*

Infinispan is available on the Infinispan
http://www.jboss.org/infinispan/downloads[downloads] page. Please use
the http://community.jboss.org/en/infinispan?view=discussions[user
forums] to communicate with us about the release. A full change log of
features in this release is on
https://jira.jboss.org/jira/secure/ConfigureReport.jspa?versions=12313464&sections=.1.7.2.4.10.9.8.3.12.11.5&style=none&selectedProjectId=12310799&reportKey=pl.net.mamut:releasenotes&Next=Next[JIRA],
and http://community.jboss.org/wiki/Infinispan[documentation] is on our
newly re-organised http://community.jboss.org/wiki/Infinispan[wiki]. We
have put together several articles, chapters and examples; feel free to
suggest new sections for this user guide - topics you may find
interesting or bits you feel we've left out or not addressed as fully.



*What's next?*

We're busy hacking away on Infinispan 4.1 features. Expect an
announcement soon on this, including an early alpha release for folks to
try out. If you're looking for Infinispan's

Cheers, and enjoy!
