As you’ve already learned from an earlier post this week, Infinispan 9
is on its final approach to landing and is bringing a new query
language. Hurray! But wait, was there something wrong with the old
one(s)? Not wrong really ...  I’ll explain.



Infinispan is a data grid of several query languages. Historically, it
has offered search support early in its existence by integrating with
Hibernate Search which provides a powerful Java-based DSL enabling you
to build Lucene queries and run them on top of your Java domain model
living in the data grid. Usage of this integration is confined to
embedded mode, but that still succeeds in making Java users happy.



While the Hibernate Search combination is neat and very appealing to
Java users it completely leaves non-JVM languages accessing Infinispan
via remote protocols out in the cold.



Enter Remote Query. Infinispan 6.0 starts to address the need of
searching the grid remotely via Hot Rod. The internals are still built
on top of Lucene and Hibernate Search bedrock but these technologies are
now hidden behind a new query API, the
https://docs.jboss.org/infinispan/9.0/apidocs/org/infinispan/query/dsl/QueryBuilder.html[QueryBuilder],
an internal DSL resembling JPA criteria query. The QueryBuilder has
implementations for both embedded mode and Hot Rod. This new API
provides all relational operators you can think of, but no full-text
search initially, we planned to add that later.



Creating a new internal DSL was fun. However, having a long term
strategy for evolving it while keeping complete backward compatibility
and also doing so uniformly across implementations in multiple languages
proved to be a difficult challenge. So while we were contemplating
adding new full-text operators to this DSL we decided on making a long
leap forward and adopt a more flexible alternative by having our own
string based query language instead, another DSL really, albeit an
external one this time.



So after the long ado, let me introduce Ickle, Infinispan’s new query
language, conspicuously resembling JP-QL.



Ickle:

* is a light and small subset of JP-QL, hence the lovely name
* queries Java classes and supports Protocol Buffers too
* queries can target a *single* entity type
* queries can filter on properties of embedded objects too, including
collections
* supports projections, aggregations, sorting, named parameters
* supports indexed and non-indexed execution
* supports complex boolean expressions
* does not support computations in expressions (eg. `user.age >
sqrt(user.shoeSize + 3)` is not allowed but `user.age >= 18` is fine)
* does not support joins
* but, navigations along embedded entities are implicit joins and are
allowed
* joining on embedded collections is allowed
* other join types not supported
* subqueries are not supported
* besides the normal relational operators it offers full-text operators,
similar to Lucene’s  query parser
* is now supported across various Infinispan APIs, wherever a Query
produced by the QueryBuilder is accepted (even for continuous queries or
in event filters for listeners!)


That is to say we squeezed JP-QL to the bare minimum and added full-text
predicates that closely follow the syntax of
https://lucene.apache.org/core/6_2_1/queryparser/org/apache/lucene/queryparser/classic/package-summary.html#package.description[Lucene’s
query parser].



If you are familiar with JPA/JP-QL then the following example will speak
for itself:


[source,sql]
----
select accountId, sum(amount) from com.acme.Transaction
    where amount < 20.0
    group by accountId
    having sum(amount) > 1000.0
    order by accountId
----

The same query can be written using the QueryBuilder:

[source,java]
----
Query query = queryFactory.from(Transaction.class)
.select(Expression.property("accountId"), Expression.sum("amount"))
.having("amount").lt(20.0)
.groupBy("accountId")
.having(Expression.sum("amount")).gt(1000.0)
.orderBy("accountId").build();
----


Both examples look nice but I hope you will agree the first one is
better.

Ickle supports several new predicates for full-text matching that the
QueryBuilder is missing. These predicates use the : operator that you
are probably familiar from Lucene’s own query language.  This example
demonstrates a simple full-text term query:


[source,sql]
----
select transactionId, amount, description from com.acme.Transaction
where amount > 10 and description : "coffee"
----


As you can see, relational predicates and full-text predicates can be
combined with boolean operators at will.



The only important thing to remark here is relational predicates are
applicable to non-analyzed fields while full-text predicates can be
applied to analyzed field only. How does indexing work, what is analysis
and how do I turn it on/off for my fields? That’s the topic of a future
post, so please be patient or start
readinghttps://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/search/5.6/reference/en-US/html_single/#_analysis[
here].



Besides term queries we support several more:

* Term                     `description : "coffee"`
* Fuzzy                    `description : "cofee"~2`
* Range                    `amount : [40 to 90}``
* Phrase                   `description : "hello world"`
* Proximity                `description : "canceling fee"~3`
* Wildcard                 `description : "te?t"`
* Regexp                   `description : /[mb]oat/`
* Boosting                 `description : "beer"^3 and description :"books"`

You can read all about them starting from
https://lucene.apache.org/core/6_2_1/queryparser/org/apache/lucene/queryparser/classic/package-summary.html#package.description[here].



But is Ickle really new? Not really. The name is new, the full-text
features are new, but a JP-QL-ish query string was always internally
present in the Query objects produced by the QueryBuilder since the
beginning of Remote Query. That language was never exposed and specified
until now. It evolved significantly over time and now it is ready for
you to use it. The QueryBuilder / criteria-like API is still there as a
convenience but it might go out of favor over time. It will be limited
to non-full-text functionality only. As Ickle grows we’ll probably not
be able to include some of the additions in the QueryBuilder in a
backward compatible manner. If growing will cause too much pain we might
consider deprecating it in favor of Ickle or if there is serious demand
for it we might continue to evolve the QueryBuilder in a non compatible
manner.



Being a string based query language, Ickle is very convenient for our
REST endpoint, the CLI, and the administration console allowing you to
quickly inspect the contents of the grid. You’ll be able to use it there
pretty soon. We’ll also continue to expand Ickle with more advanced
full-text features like spatial queries and faceting, but that’s a
subject for another major version. Until then, why not grab the current
9.0 Beta1 and test drive the new query language yourself? We’d love to
hear your feedback on
the https://developer.jboss.org/en/infinispan/content[ forum], on
our https://issues.jboss.org/projects/ISPN[ issue tracker] or on IRC on
the #infinispan channel
on http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=%23infinispan[ Freenode].



Happy coding!
