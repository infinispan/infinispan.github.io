I'm happy to announce that I've revamped the JGroups workshop and I'll
be teaching 2 workshops in November: Rome Nov 7-10 and Berlin Nov
21-24.

The new workshop is 4 days (TUE-FRI). I've updated the workshop to use
the latest version of JGroups (4.0.x), removed a few sections and added
sections on troubleshooting/diagnosis and handling of network partitions
(split brain).

Should be a fun and hands-on workshop!
