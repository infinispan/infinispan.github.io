Infinispan team is coming to
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%C3%A3o_Paulo[São Paulo] (Brazil) to
present on multiple topics around caching, data grids and NoSQL in
http://www.jboss.org/events/JUDCon/2013/brazil[Brazil's first ever JBoss
Users & Developers Conference (JUDCon)]. The event is being held over
two days, on 19th and 20th of April.

On the 19th, Manik Surtani and Pete Muir will present on
http://www.jboss.org/events/JUDCon/2013/brazil/speakers.html#maniksurtani1[how
to supercharge web applications using JBoss Data Grid]. Expect a very
lively presentation from these very seasoned presenters :)

Another presentation where you'll be able to see Infinispan in action is
in Shekhar Gulati's
http://www.jboss.org/events/JUDCon/2013/brazil/speakers.html#shekhargulati1["Closed
PaaS to Open PaaS : Migrate GAE Applications to OpenShift Using
CapeDwarf"] and Randall Hauch's
http://www.jboss.org/events/JUDCon/2013/brazil/speakers.html#randallhauch1["Elastic
Consistent NoSQL Data Storage with ModeShape 3"] talk, both on the 19th
of April, where Shekhar and Randal will demonstrate JBoss projects using
Infinispan heavily.

On 20th of April, I'll be speaking about
http://www.jboss.org/events/JUDCon/2013/brazil/speakers.html#galderzamerreno2[scaling
up Hibernate/JPA applications with Infinispan second-level cache]. Even
if the Infinispan caching provider was created almost 4 years ago, this
is the first time I'm presenting about it. Really looking forward to
that.

Finally, I'll also give the
http://www.jboss.org/events/JUDCon/2013/brazil/speakers.html[first ever
presentation on Infinispan JCache (JSR-107) API implementation], which
will be mostly a live coding session showing different bits about JCache
API and the extra capabilities JCache users get from using Infinispan
implementation.

Cheers,
Galder
