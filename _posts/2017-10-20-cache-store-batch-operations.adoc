Infinispan 9.1.x introduces batch write and delete operations for cache
stores. The introduction of batching should greatly improve performance
when utilising write-behind cache stores, using putAll operations and
committing transactions in non-transactional stores.

== CacheWriter Interface Additions



The CacheWriter interface has been extended so that it exposes two
additional methods: deleteBatch and writeBatch.  For the sake of
backwards compatibility a default implementation of these methods is
provided, however if your cache store is able to utilise batching we
strongly recommend you create your  own implementations. The additional
methods and docs are show below: 







=== Updated Stores



Currently the JDBC, JPA, RocksDB and Remote stores have all been
modified to take advantage of these latest changes.

== 

== 



== Configuration Changes



As each store implementations has different batching capabilities, it
was necessary to introduce a max-batch-size attribute to the
AbstractStoreConfiguration. This attribute defines the maximum number of
entries that should be included in a single batch operation to the
store. If a value less than one is provided, then the underlying store
implementation should not place a upper limit on the number of entries
in a batch. 

=== Deprecated Attributes

Both TableManipulationConfiguration#batchSize and
JpaStoreConfiguration#batchSize have been deprecated, as they serve the
same purpose as AbstractStoreConfiguration#maxBatchSize.


== Store Benchmark


To measure the impact of batch writes on Cache.putAll, we created a
https://github.com/ryanemerson/benchmarks/tree/master/store[simple
benchmark] to compare the performance of Infinispan 9.1.1.Final (with
batching) and 9.0.3.Final (without).  The benchmark consisted of 20
threads inserting 100000 cache entries as fast as possible into a cache
via putAll; with each putAll operation containing 20 cache entries and
the max-batch-size of each store being set to 20. The table below shows
the average time taken for each store type after the benchmark was
executed three times.

|======================================================
|Store Type |9.0.3.Final |9.1.1-Final |Latency Decrease
|JdbcStringBasedStore |29368ms |2597ms |91.12%
|JPAStore |30798ms |16640ms |45.97%
|RocksDBStore |1164ms |209ms |82.04%
|======================================================

The benchmark results above clearly show that performance is increased
dramatically when utilising batch updates at the store level.

== Conclusions

Infinispan 9.1.x introduces batching capabilities to the CacheWriter
interface in order to improve performance. If you currently utilise a
custom cache store, we strongly recommend that you provide your own
implementation of the delete and write batch methods.
