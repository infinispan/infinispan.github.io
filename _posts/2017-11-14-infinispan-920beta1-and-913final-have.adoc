Dear Infinispan Community,

Two new releases are ready for you today, our newest and greatest
9.2.0.Beta1 and an updated Final of our stable branch, 9.1.3. Both can
be found as usual on our
downloadÂ http://infinispan.org/download/[page].

The highlights of 9.2.0.Beta1 are:


* New API for querying using Ickle via the REST server, taking advantage
of the JSON/Protobuf interoperability
[https://issues.jboss.org/browse/ISPN-8113[ISPN-8113]].
* Clustered Locks, first experimental release. A _ClusteredLock_ is a
data structure used for concurrent programming between Infinispan
instances in cluster mode.
* Clustered Counters have received serveral improvements. It's now
possible to manage your counters via JMX
[https://issues.jboss.org/browse/ISPN-7926[ISPN-7926]] and other
management methods are on the way. The strong counter has a new method:
_compare-and-swap_
[https://issues.jboss.org/browse/ISPN-8489[ISPN-8489]]. If you used
_compare-and-set_, the _compare-and-swap_ may improve your code
performance. And last but not least, a new _sync()_ method was added to
the strong and weak counters, useful if you don't want to handle the
CompletableFuture!
https://issues.jboss.org/browse/ISPN-8379[]
* Clustered Cache Configuration: Both _EmbeddedCacheManager_ and
_RemoteCacheManager_ now have an API for creating/removing caches across
the cluster [https://issues.jboss.org/browse/ISPN-7776[ISPN-7776]].
Caches created with this API will also be created on any new members
that will join the cluster. Additionally, the configuration for caches
created in this way can be made persistent so that they are
automatically recreated when a cluster restarts.
* Server deployment of Lucene analyzers for remote query
[https://issues.jboss.org/browse/ISPN-7714[ISPN-7714]].
https://issues.jboss.org/browse/ISPN-7865[]


9.1.3.Final and 9.2.0.Beta1 both add several Off-heap improvements and
fixes.

Full details of the new features and enhancements included in these two
releases can be found

and

We have even more exciting stuff coming up for Infinispan 9.2. Thank you
for following us and stay tuned!
