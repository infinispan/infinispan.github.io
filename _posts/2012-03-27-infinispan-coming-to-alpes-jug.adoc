I was meant to speak in the http://www.alpesjug.fr/[Alpes JUG] in
Grenoble about Infinispan back in December, but due to a health issue, I
was unable to attend. http://www.alpesjug.fr/?p=1132[This session] has
now been rescheduled for this coming Thursday, 29th of March. As always,
I will be speaking about all thing Infinispan, caching, data grids.
Really looking forward to it! :)

Cheers,
Galder
