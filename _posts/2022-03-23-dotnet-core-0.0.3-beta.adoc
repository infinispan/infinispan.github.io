* remote event listener.
* cluster failover configuration.
* TLS with server cert verification.
* some new hotrod operations. https://rigazilla.github.io/Infinispan.Hotrod.Core/html/class_infinispan_1_1_hotrod_1_1_core_1_1_cache.html[(Check if your favourite Hotrod op is in!)]

Good starting point could be the https://github.com/infinispan/Infinispan.Hotrod.Core/tree/main/Infinispan.Hotrod.Application[sample application].
Documentation is growing up, temporarily placed https://rigazilla.github.io/Infinispan.Hotrod.Core/html/[here].

Please let us know your thoughts. A good place to share them is the https://github.com/infinispan/Infinispan.Hotrod.Core/issues[issues] page.
