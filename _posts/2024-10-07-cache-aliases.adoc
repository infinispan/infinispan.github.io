In Infinispan 15 we provided a large set of commands to make it possible to replace your Redis Server
by Infinispan, without changing your code. In this tutorial you will learn how Infinispan cache aliases
will help you on replacing your Redis Server by Infinispan for multiple Redis databases.

Key takeaways:

* What are cache aliases and how to create caches with aliases or update existing ones
* Learn how Infinispan and Redis differ in data organization
* Support multiple databases in Infinispan with cache aliases when using the **RESP protocol**

_Supporting multiple Redis databases is available since Infinispan 15.0 (latest stable release at the time of this writing).
However, Hot Rod, CLI and Infinispan Console support is Tech Preview in Infinispan 15.1 (in development right now)._

## Redis Hot Replacement for Infinispan
Since Infinispan 15, you can use Infinispan as a hot replacement for Redis because it supports most Redis
commands through the RESP protocol. This works because Infinispan Server has the RESP endpoint enabled by
default. Redis clients will automatically connect and be routed to Infinispan’s internal connector.

### Running the Infinispan Server and using a Redis client
Testing a Redis client with Infinispan Server is very easy.

First run the Infinispan Server as explained in the https://infinispan.org/get-started/[Getting Started tutorial].

*Important: Caches aliases fully work from 15.1.0.Dev04 release. Make sure you pull the latest 15.1 image locally.*

*Command line with Docker or Podman*
----
docker run -it -p 11222:11222 -e USER="admin" -e PASS="password" quay.io/infinispan/server:15.1

podman run -it -p 11222:11222 -e USER="admin" -e PASS="password" --net=host quay.io/infinispan/server:15.1
----


Next, connect to Infinispan using https://redis.io/docs/latest/develop/connect/cli/[Redis-CLI].
Use port **11222** instead of the default **6379**. Since Infinispan is secured by default, make sure
to provide the admin credentials.

----
> redis-cli -p 11222 --user admin --pass password
127.0.0.1:11222> set hello world
OK
127.0.0.1:11222> get hello
"world"
----

_**That’s all!**_

If you're wondering where the data is stored, it’s in the **“respCache”**. This is the default cache
used by the Infinispan RESP connector, and it's pre-configured with sensible defaults.
It’s ready to use and serves as a good replacement for Redis. Please note that starting with I
nfinispan 15.1, the data container cache list includes a new column called "Aliases".
We'll cover that later.

### Redis Databases versus Infinispan Caches
In Redis, databases are essentially separate, isolated namespaces within a single Redis server.
Each database can store its own set of key-value pairs independently from the others.

By default, Redis provides 16 databases, numbered from 0 to 15. You can switch between these databases
using the SELECT command. This feature helps organize data and isolate different applications or use cases
within the same Redis instance, though it's important to note that all databases share the same memory
space and configuration settings.

Infinispan on the other hand employs a distributed cache model where data is spread across multiple nodes.
It doesn't use the concept of separate databases; instead, it organizes data using caches, which can be
configured with different settings and partitioned across a cluster. Data is distributed and replicated across multiple nodes, offering high availability and scalability. There isn’t a direct equivalent to Redis’s databases, but data can be segmented using different caches and configurations.

Here is a table that resumes the main differences between Redis Databases and Infinispan caches:

[cols="1,1,1"]
|===
|Aspect|Redis Database|Infinispan Cache

|**Definition**
|A logical namespace within a single Redis instance, allowing isolation of keys and values. Default of 16 databases per instance. All databases share server resources and configuration.
|A container for key-value pairs within a distributed or in-memory cache. Can be distributed across multiple nodes, with multiple caches configurable within the same instance.

|**Storage Model**
|Stores data in a single server’s memory with simple key-value storage. Databases are isolated from each other but share server resources.
|Stores data across a cluster of nodes with features like partitioning, replication, and distributed caching. Suitable for large-scale and high-availability scenarios.

|**Isolation**
|Provides isolation between databases using the _SELECT_ command. All databases share memory and configuration settings.
|Provides isolation and configuration flexibility at the cache level. Each cache can be independently configured and may be distributed or replicated.

|**Configuration and Flexibility**
|Limited to basic configuration options related to the database index and server settings. All databases share the same server resources.
|Extensive configuration options for each cache, including different modes (e.g., local, distributed, replicated), eviction policies, and more.
|===

If the Infinispan connector uses a single cache named “respCache” by default,
you can support multiple Redis databases… by using **cache aliases**.

## Cache alias to rescue
In Infinispan, cache aliases are alternative names you can assign to a cache.
They allow you to refer to the same underlying cache configuration using different names.
Cache aliases in Infinispan allow for efficient switching between different versions or states
of cached data, without having to modify or reload your application logic. This makes cache
aliases especially useful in scenarios where data needs to be updated, but you want to ensure
high availability and minimal impact to application performance.

### Use cases for cache aliases
Cache aliases in Infinispan are great for managing changing data without disrupting
your application. It allows you to switch between data snapshots easily. You can keep
using an old data version while loading a new one. When the new data is ready, you just
switch the alias to point to it, without downtime. There is better performance and high
availability since your app doesn’t touch the cache that’s being updated, it runs smoothly
without slowdowns or errors. If something goes wrong, you can quickly rollback and switch
to the previous data version with the alias.

For example, imagine an online shop that needs to update its catalog:

1. The shop keeps showing products using the current data (_current_catalog_ pointing to _catalog_snapshot_1_).
1. While customers browse, new product data is loaded into _catalog_snapshot_2_ in the background.
1. Once _catalog_snapshot_2_ is fully updated, the alias (_current_catalog_) is switched to point to _catalog_snapshot_2_.
1. he old _catalog_snapshot_1_ cache is now free to be cleared and used for the next update.

The website updates its catalog data without causing big delays or downtime for users.

## Creating a cache with an alias
Before learning how to use cache aliases for the RESP protocol and multiple databases,
let’s first learn how to create and update cache aliases. There are several ways to create
a cache or cache configuration in Infinispan, but my favorite is using the **Infinispan Server Console**.

Run the Infinispan Server and access the Console as explained in the https://infinispan.org/get-started/[“Getting started tutorial”].
To create a cache, use the cache creation wizard by clicking the **"Create Cache"** button.
In the cache tuning step, you'll find the "Aliases" option, where you can add as many aliases as you want.

image::/assets/images/blog/2024-09-26-cache-aliases/createAndAddAlias.png[Create cache with aliases]

In the final step, you'll be able to review the configuration in **JSON**, **XML**, or **YAML** formats.

image::/assets/images/blog/2024-09-26-cache-aliases/confirmCacheWithAlias.png[Confirm cache with aliases]

When you create a cache with aliases, the list will show the cache's aliases.
You can filter caches by name or alias using the “search by” field..

## Adding an alias at runtime
For existing caches, good news! The aliases attribute in a cache configuration can be
changed at runtime. You can do this in several ways:

* Using the **administration API** in **Hotrod**
* Using the Infinispan Server Command Line Interface (CLI)
* Using the *Server Console* or *REST API*

*To perform this operation, you need ADMIN access in Infinispan.*

### Using the Hotrod Client
To modify an alias at runtime, use the administration API. Below is an example for client/server mode.
If you're using Infinispan Embedded in your application, a similar API is available.

[source, java]
----
RemoteCacheManager remoteCacheManager = // created or injected if using Quarkus or Spring Boot
remoteCacheManager.administration().updateConfigurationAttribute("myCache", "aliases", "alias alias2");
RemoteCache<String, String> cacheFromAlias = cacheManager.getCache("alias");
----

Check this example and more in the https://infinispan.org/tutorials/simple/simple_tutorials.html[Infinispan Simple Tutorials].

### Using the Command Line Tool
The Command Line Tool (CLI) of Infinispan provides a way to change cache aliases at runtime.

First, run the CLI with the following command:
[source, bash]
----
podman/docker run -it --net=host infinispan/cli
----

From the command line, connect to the running server:
[source, bash]
----
[disconnected]> connect
Username: admin
Password: ********
[6b0130c153e3-50183@cluster//containers/default]>
----

Then, use “alter cache” command to update aliases attribute:
[source, bash]
----
alter cache myCache2 --attribute=aliases --value=current_catalog
----
Finally, describe the configuration of the cache and verify the change:
[source, bash]
----
[6b0130c153e3-50183@cluster//containers/default]> describe caches/cache2
{
  "myCache2" : {
    "distributed-cache" : {
      "aliases" : [ "current_catalog" ],
      "owners" : "2",
      "mode" : "SYNC",
      "statistics" : true,
      "encoding" : {
        "media-type" : "application/x-protostream"
      }
    }
  }
}
----
*TIP: Use help command*
[source, bash]
----
[6b0130c153e3-50183@cluster//containers/default]> alter cache -h
Usage: alter cache [<options>] <name>
Alters a cache configuration

Options:
--attribute  The configuration attribute
--value      The value for the configuration attribute. If the attribute supports multiple values, separate them with commas
-f, --file
-h, --help

Argument:
The cache name
----

### Using the Server Console
From the list of caches, select _Edit aliases_ action.
[caption="Edit aliases",link=/assets/images/blog/2024-09-26-cache-aliases/editAliasAction.png]
image::/assets/images/blog/2024-09-26-cache-aliases/editAliasAction.png[Edit aliases]

A modal dialog will open. You can add or remove aliases from there.

## Supporting multiple databases
Let’s try selecting databases 0 and 1 using the Redis CLI. To switch databases in Redis,
use the _SELECT_ command followed by the database number. Lets try over Infinispan again.

First, use `SELECT 0` to start in database 0. Then, use `SELECT 1` to switch to database 1.
[source, bash]
----
> redis-cli  --user admin --pass password
127.0.0.1:11222[1]> select 0
OK
127.0.0.1:11222[1]> select 1
(error) ERR DB index is out of range
----

Database 0 works, but database 1 does not.
On closer inspection of the *respCache* configuration, we see the default *respCache* with
*alias "0"* is defined.

[caption="Resp cache config",link=/assets/images/blog/2024-09-26-cache-aliases/respCacheConfig.png]
image::/assets/images/blog/2024-09-26-cache-aliases/respCacheConfig.png[Resp cache config]

To select *database “1”*, you need to create a new cache.
Lets use the Infinispan Console again to do that.
Go to the cache creation wizard and choose “add cache configuration” option this time.

[caption="Create cache with config",link=/assets/images/blog/2024-09-26-cache-aliases/addCacheConfig.png]
image::/assets/images/blog/2024-09-26-cache-aliases/addCacheConfig.png[Create cache with config]

Choose the *RESP.DIST* template and create the cache. This template is specifically
designed for RESP caches.

[caption="RESP template",link=/assets/images/blog/2024-09-26-cache-aliases/selectRESPDIST.png]
image::/assets/images/blog/2024-09-26-cache-aliases/selectRESPDIST.png[RESP template]

Finally, *add alias "1"* to the new cache as described in the section on adding an alias at runtime.
Alternatively, you can copy and paste the configuration from *respCache* changing the alias `0` to alias `1`.

[caption="Two RESP caches",link=/assets/images/blog/2024-09-26-cache-aliases/twoRESPCaches.png]
image::/assets/images/blog/2024-09-26-cache-aliases/twoRESPCaches.png[Two RESP caches]

Now that we have a cache with alias `1`, we can select and add the data:
[source, bash]
----
> redis-cli  --user admin --pass password
127.0.0.1:11222[1]> select 0
OK
127.0.0.1:11222[1]> select 1
OK
127.0.0.1:11222[1]> set hello word
OK
----

It is *important* to highlight that, *unlike Redis Databases, each cache can be set
up differently based on your application's needs*. This lets you take advantage of
Infinispan's flexible configuration (For example, you can add backups using Cross-Site Replication
for some “databases” and not all of them) while still keeping the simplicity of
using your Redis client in your app.

## Conclusions
In this tutorial, you’ve learned how to use multiple databases with the RESP protocol
and how to use Infinispan caches as a replacement for Redis databases.
By using different caches instead of Redis databases, you gain several advantages,
as discussed. You can now approach your data needs in a more flexible and effective way,
tailored to your specific scenarios. You have also learned what cache aliases are and how
helpful they can be in different situations, not just Redis databases.
