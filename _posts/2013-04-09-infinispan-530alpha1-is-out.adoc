With a code name hard to match -
http://www.brewdog.com/product/tactical-nuclear-penguin[Tactical Nuclear
Penguin] - and besides almost 50 bug fixes, this release contains
several important features:

* Total Order (TO) transaction protocol developed within the scope of
the http://www.cloudtm.eu/[CloudTM] project. The TO exhibits very good
throughput in scenarios in which multiple transactions modify the same
key set concurrently (high contention)
* support for https://github.com/jsr107/jsr107spec[JSR-107] (Java
Caching API) implementation, allowing Infinispan to be used as a cache
provider 
* A new implementation of the Lucene Directory for Infinispan based on
Lucene 4. Compatible now with all versions of Apache Lucene from 2.4 to
4.2.
* A new packaging for the Infinispan server modules, based on the JBoss
AS

Please stay tuned for blogs detailing all these features. For a complete
list of features included in this release refer to the
