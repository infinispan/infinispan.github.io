DataContainer abstraction represents the heart of Infinispan. It is a
container structure where actual cache data resides. Every put, remove,
get and other invoked cache operations eventually end up in the data
container. Therefore, it is of utmost importance the data container is
implemented in a way that does not impede overall system throughput.
Also recall that the data container's memory footprint can not grow
indefinitely because we would eventually run out of memory; we have to
periodically evict certain entries from the data container according to
a chosen eviction algorithm.



LRU eviction algorithm, although simple and easy to understand, under
performs in cases of weak access locality (one time access entries are
not timely replaced, entries to be accessed soonest are unfortunately
replaced, and so on). Recently, a new eviction algorithm -
http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=511334.511340[LIRS] has gathered a
lot of attention because it addresses weak access locality shortcomings
of LRU yet it retains LRU's simplicity.



However, no matter what eviction algorithm is utilized, if eviction is
not implemented in a scalable, low lock contention approach, it can
seriously degrade overall system performance. In order to do any
meaningful selection of entries for eviction we have to lock data
container until appropriate eviction entries are selected. Having such a
lock protected data container in turn causes high lock contention
offsetting any eviction precision gained by sophisticated eviction
algorithms. In order to get superior throughput while retaining high
eviction precision we need both low lock contention data container and
high precision eviction algorithm implementation – a seemingly
impossible feat.



Instead of making a trade-off between the high precision eviction
algorithm and the low lock contention there is
http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1546683.1547428[a third approach]:
we keep lock protected data container but we amortize locking cost
through batching updates. The basic idea is to wrap any eviction
algorithm with a framework that keeps track of cache access per thread
(i.e. ThreadLocal) in a simple queue. For each cache hit associated with
a thread, the access is recorded in the thread’s queue. If thread's
queue is full or the number of accesses recorded in the queue reaches a
certain pre-determined threshold, we acquire a lock and then execute
operations defined by the eviction algorithm - once for all the accesses
in the queue. A thread is allowed to access many cache items without
requesting a lock to run the eviction replacement algorithm, or without
paying the lock acquisition cost. We fully exploit a non-blocking lock
APIs like tryLock. As you recall tryLock makes an attempt to get the
lock and if the lock is currently held by another thread, it fails
without blocking its caller thread. Although tryLock is cheap it is not
used for every cache access for obvious reasons but rather on certain
pre-determined thresholds. In case when thread's queue is totally full a
lock must be explicitly requested. Therefore, using batching updates
approach we significantly lower the cost of lock contention, streamline
access to locked structures and retain the precision of eviction
algorithm such as LIRS. The key insight is that batching the updates on
the eviction algorithm doesn't materially affect the accuracy of the
algorithm.



How are these ideas implemented in Infinispan? We introduced
BoundedConcurrentHashMap class based on Doug Lea's ConcurrentHashMap.
BoundedConcurrentHashMap hashes entries based on their keys into lock
protected segments. Instead of recording entries accessed per thread we
record them in a lock free queue on a segment level. The main reason not
to use ThreadLocal is that we could potentially have hundreds of threads
hitting the data container, some of them very short lived thus possibly
never reaching batching thresholds. When predetermined thresholds are
reached eviction algorithms is executed on a segment level. Would
running eviction algorithm on a segment level rather than entire data
container impact overall eviction precision? In our performance tests we
have not found any evidence of that.



Infinispan's eviction algorithm is specified using strategy attribute of
eviction XML element. In addition to old eviction approaches, starting
with release 4.1.ALPHA2, you can now select LIRS eviction algorithm. LRU
remains the default. Also note that starting with 4.1ALPHA2 release
there are two distinct approaches to actually evict entries from the
cache: piggyback and the default approach using a dedicated
EvictionManager thread. Piggyback eviction thread policy, as it name
implies, does eviction by piggybacking on user threads that are hitting
the data container. Dedicated EvictionManager thread is unchanged from
the previous release and it remains the default option. In order to
support these two eviction thread policies a new eviction attribute
threadPolicy has been added to eviction element of Infinispan
configuration schema.



Does eviction redesign based on batching updates promise to live up to
its expectations? Ding et al, authors of the original batching proposal,
found that their framework increased throughput nearly twofold in
comparison with unmodified eviction in postgreSQL 8.2.3. We do not have
any numbers to share yet, however, initial testing of
BoundedConcurrentHashMap were indeed promising. One of our partner
companies replaced their crucial caching component with
BoundedConcurrentHashMap and realized a 54% performance improvement on
the Berlin SPARQL benchmark for their flagship product. Stay tuned for
more updates.
