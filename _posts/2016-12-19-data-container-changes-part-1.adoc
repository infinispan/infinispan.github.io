Infinispan 9.0 Beta 1 introduces some big changes to the Infinispan data
container.  This is the first of two blog posts detailing those
changes.

This post will cover the changes to eviction which utilizes a new
provider, https://github.com/ben-manes/caffeine[Caffeine].  As you may
already know Infinispan has supported our own implementations of
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cache_replacement_policies#LRU[LRU] (Least
Recently Used) and
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LIRS_caching_algorithm[LIRS] (Low
Inter-reference Receny Set) algorithms for our bounded caches.

Our implementations of eviction were even rewritten for Infinispan 8,
but we found we still had some issues or limitations with them,
especially LIRS.  Our old implementation had some problems with keeping
the correct number of entries.  The new implementation while not having
that issue had others, such as being considerably more complex.  And
while it implemented the entire LIRS specification, it could have memory
usage https://issues.jboss.org/browse/ISPN-7171[issues].  This led us to
looking at alternatives and Caffeine seemed like a logical fit as well
as being well maintained and the author, Ben Manes, is quite
responsive.


== Enter Caffeine


Caffeine doesn't utilize LRU or LIRS for its eviction algorithm and
instead implements https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.00727[TinyLFU] with an
admission window.  This has the benefit of the high hit ratio like LIRS,
while also requiring low memory overhead like LRU.  Caffeine also
provides custom weighting for objects, which allow us to reuse the code
that was developed for MEMORY based eviction as well.

The only thing that Caffeine doesn't support is our idea of a custom
https://docs.jboss.org/infinispan/8.2/apidocs/org/infinispan/commons/equivalence/Equivalence.html[Equivalence]. 
Thus Infinispan now wraps byte[] instances to ensure equals and hashCode
methods work properly.  This also gives us a good opportunity to
reevaluate the dataContainer configuration element.


== Deprecations


The data container configuration has thus been deprecated and is now
replaced by a new configuration element named memory.   Also since we
are adding a new element the eviction configuration could also be
consolidated into memory, and thus eviction is also deprecated.  And
last but not least the storeAsBinary configuration element has also been
integrated into the new memory configuration element.  Now we have 1
configuration element instead of 3, can't beat that!


== New Configuration


The new memory configuration will start out pretty simple and new
elements can be added as there is a need.  The memory element will be
composed of a single sub element that can be of three different
choices.  For this post we will go over two of the sub elements: OBJECT
and BINARY.


=== OBJECT


Object storage stores the actual objects as provided from the user in
the Java Heap.  This is the default storage method when no memory
configuration is provided.  This method will provide the best
performance when using operations that operate upon the entire data set,
such as distributed streams, indexing and local reads etc.

Unfortunately OBJECT storage only allows for COUNT based eviction as we
cannot properly estimate user object types properly.  This could be
improved in a feature version if there is enough interest. Note that you
can technically configured MEMORY eviction type with the OBJECT storage
type with declarative configuration, but it will throw an exception when
you build the configuration.  Therefore OBJECT only has a single element
named size to determine the amount of entries that can be stored in the
cache.

An example of how Object storage can be configured:

==== XML

DECLARATIVE



=== BINARY


Binary storage stores the object in its serialized form in a byte
array.  This has an interesting side effect of objects are always stored
as a deep copy.  This can be useful if you want to modify an object
after retrieving it without affecting the underlying cache stored
object.  Since objects have to be deserialized when performing
operations on them some things such as distributed streams and local
gets will be a little bit slower.

A nice benefit of storing entries as BINARY is that we can estimate the
total on heap size of the object.  Thus BINARY supports both COUNT and
MEMORY based eviction types.

An example of how Binary storage can be configured:

==== XML

DECLARATIVE



=== OFF-HEAP


This option will be described in more detail in the next blog post. 
Stay tuned!


== Conclusion


Caffeine should bring us a great solution, while also reducing a lot of
maintenance ourselves.  The new memory configuration also provides a
simpler solution by removing two other configuration elements.

We hope you enjoy the new changes to the data container and look out for
another blog post coming soon to detail the other new changes to the
data container!  In the meantime please check out our latest
