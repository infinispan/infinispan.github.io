The highlights of this release are:

* interoperability between Hot Rod, Memcached, REST and embedded mode.
E.g. it is now possible to write data through an REST interface and read
it through Hot Rod or the other way around
* the ability to expose the same container over multiple Hot Rod
endpoints and the integration of the WebSocket endpoint

Please stay tuned for blogs detailing these features.
