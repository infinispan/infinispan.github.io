Yes, at last.  Intentions
http://infinispan.blogspot.co.uk/2011/05/red-hat-announces-enterprise-data-grid.html[first
announced] last year, and
http://infinispan.blogspot.co.uk/2012/04/introducing-jboss-data-grid-infinispan.html[beta
programme] launched a few months ago, Red Hat's
http://www.redhat.com/products/jbossenterprisemiddleware/data-grid/[JBoss
Data Grid (JDG) 6.0 is now in final, GA form].  This supported release
is based on
http://infinispan.blogspot.co.uk/2012/05/infinispan-515-goes-final.html[Infinispan
5.1.5.Final], and you can read more about it here.

It has been picked up
http://finance.yahoo.com/news/red-hat-addresses-enterprises-better-143000595.html[by
the press] too.

Open source.  And enterprise-grade.  :-)

Enjoy!
