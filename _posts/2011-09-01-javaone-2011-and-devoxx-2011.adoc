never got around to blogging about this when my talks were accepted for
http://www.oracle.com/javaone/index.html[JavaOne] this year, but it's
about time.

I have a conference session titled
"https://oracleus.wingateweb.com/content/sessionDetail.do?SESSION_ID=23382[A
Tale About Caching (JSR 107) and Data Grids (JSR 347) in Enterprise
Java]" and a BoF session focused on JSR 347 titled
"https://oracleus.wingateweb.com/content/sessionDetail.do?SESSION_ID=23380[Making
Java EE Cloud-Friendly: JSR 347, Data Grids for the Java Platform]",
which I will be delivering with fellow Infinispan developer, JBoss
rockstar and overall nice guy
http://community.jboss.org/people/petemuir[Pete Muir].

on in the year, I will also be running a University talk at
http://www.devoxx.com/display/DV11/Home[Devoxx] in Antwerp, titled
"http://www.devoxx.com/display/DV11/Real-world+deep-dive+into+Infinispan+-+the+open+source+data+grid+platform[A
real-world deep-dive into Infinispan]".  This too will be with Pete and
http://community.jboss.org/people/mircea.markus[Mircea Markus], another
core Infinispan developer.

This will be a great chance to learn more about Infinispan, data grids,
JSR 107 and JSR 347, so if you are attending these conferences, make
sure you add these talks to your agenda!  :-)

Cheers
Manik
