While Infinispan has got the distributed, in-memory data grid market
firmly it in its sight, there is also another aspect of Infinispan which
I feel people would find interesting.



At its heart Infinispan is a highly concurrent, extremely performant
data structure than can be distributed, or could be used in a
standalone, local mode - as a cache. But why would people use Infinispan
over, say, a
http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/ConcurrentHashMap.html[#ConcurrentHashMap#]?
Here are some reasons.



*_#Feature-rich#_*

* *Eviction.* Built-in eviction ensures you don't run out of memory.
* *Write-through and write-behind caching.* Going beyond memory and onto
disk (or any other pluggable
http://docs.jboss.org/infinispan/4.0/apidocs/org/infinispan/loaders/CacheStore.html[#CacheStore#])
means that your state survives restarts, and preloaded hot caches can be
configured.
* *JTA support and XA compliance.* Participate in ongoing transactions
with any
http://java.sun.com/javaee/technologies/jta/index.jsp[JTA]-compliant
transaction manager.
* *MVCC-based concurrency.* Highly optimized for fast, non-blocking
readers.
* *Manageability.*
http://docs.jboss.org/infinispan/4.0/apidocs/jmxComponents.html[Simple
JMX] or rich GUI management console via
http://community.jboss.org/wiki/MonitoringInfinispanwithJOPR[JOPR], you
have a choice.
* *Not just for the JVM.*
http://community.jboss.org/wiki/InfinispanRESTserver[RESTful API], and
upcoming
http://community.jboss.org/wiki/Clientandservermodules[client/server
modules] speaking Memcached and
http://community.jboss.org/wiki/HotRodProtocol[HotRod] protocols help
non-JVM platforms use Infinispan.
* *Cluster-ready.* Should the need arise.

_*#Easy to configure, easy to use#*_

The simplest configuration file containing just

[source,xml]
----
<infinispan />
----

is enough to get you started, with sensible defaults abound. (More
detailed documentation is
http://docs.jboss.org/infinispan/4.0/apidocs/config.html[also
available]).



All the features above are exposed via an easy-to-use
http://docs.jboss.org/infinispan/4.0/apidocs/org/infinispan/Cache.html[#Cache#]
interface, which extends
http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/ConcurrentMap.html[#ConcurrentMap#]
and is compatible with many other cache systems. Infinispan even ships
with
http://community.jboss.org/wiki/ConfigurationMigrationTools[migration
tools] to help you move off other cache solutions onto Infinispan,
whether you need a cache to store data retrieved remotely or simply as a
http://community.jboss.org/wiki/usinginfinispanasjpahibernatesecondlevelcacheprovider[2nd
level cache for Hibernate].



_*#Performance#*_

In the process of testing and tuning Infinispan on very large clusters,
we have started to put together a
http://cachebenchfwk.sourceforge.net/[benchmarking framework]. As a part
of this framework, we have the ability to measure cache performance in
standalone, local mode. So in the context of this blog post, I'd

like to share some recent performance numbers of Infinispan - a recent
snapshot - compared against the latest JBoss Cache release (3.2.2.GA)
and EHCache (1.7.2). Some background on the tests:

* Used a latest snapshot of the
http://cachebenchfwk.sourceforge.net/[CacheBenchFwk]
* Run on a http://www.redhat.com/rhel/[RHEL] 5 server with 4 Intel Xeon
cores, 4GB of RAM
* Sun JDK 1.6.0_18, with #-Xms1g -Xmx1g#
* Test run on a single node, with 25 concurrent threads, using randomly
generated Strings as keys and values and a 1kb payload for each entry,
with a 80/20 read/write ratio.
* Performance measured in transactions per second (higher = better).

In summary, what we have here is that when run in local mode, Infinispan
is a high-performance standalone caching engine which offers a rich set
of features while still being trivially simple to configure and use.



Enjoy,

Manik
