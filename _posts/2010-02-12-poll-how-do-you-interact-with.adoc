While discussing the different ways to interact with Infinispan, we
decided to open up a poll so that people tell us how they expect to be
using Infinispan. Do you use Infinispan directly on the same VM? Or do
you use REST? Are you planning to interact via memcached or Hot Rod
interface?

The poll can be found
http://community.jboss.org/poll.jspa?poll=1035[here]. Please make sure
that if you vote, you add a comment indicating the reasons why you
chosen that option.

Cheers,
Galder
