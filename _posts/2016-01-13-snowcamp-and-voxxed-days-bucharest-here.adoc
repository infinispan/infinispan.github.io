I'll be presenting about Infinispan's in a couple of conferences over
the next few months:

First up is http://snowcamp.io/2016/en/[SnowCamp 2016], a conference
taking place in Grenoble from 21st to 23rd January. The talk I'm
presenting is titled
https://snowcamp2016.sched.org/event/5meE/distributed-data-processing-with-infinispan-and-java-streams?iframe=no["Distributed
Data Processing with Infinispan and Java Streams"]. Java 8 has made data
processing easier than ever and with the help of Infinispan, that data
processing can easily be done in a distributed manner. This talk is
focused on showing how to use Java Streams to do distributed data
processing with Infinispan, and how this approach compares with other
data processing APIs Infinispan exposes.

Next, on the 11th of March I'll be in Bucharest to speak at Voxxed Days
Bucharest where I'll again be talking about
http://voxxeddays.com/bucharest/2016/01/09/distributed-data-processing-with-infinispan-and-java-streams/[Distributed
Data Processing with Infinispan and Java Streams].

So, if you're in Grenoble or Bucharest, make sure you come to SnowCamp
or Voxxed Days Bucharest to learn about Infinispan!! :)

Cheers,
Galder
