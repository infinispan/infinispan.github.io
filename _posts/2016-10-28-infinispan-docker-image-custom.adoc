In the
http://blog.infinispan.org/2016/07/improved-infinispan-docker-image.html[previous
post] we introduced the improved Docker image for Infinispan and showed
how to run it with different parameters in order to create standalone,
clustered and domain mode servers.

This post will show how to address more advanced configuration changes
than swapping the JGroups stack, covering cases like creating extra
caches or using a pre-existent configuration file.


====  

==== Runtime configuration changes


Since the Infinispan server is based on Wildfly, it also supports the
Command Line Interface (CLI) to change configurations at runtime.

Let's consider an example of a custom indexed cache with Infinispan
storage. In order to configure it, we need 4 caches, one cache to hold
our data, called _testCache_ and other three caches to hold the
indexes:  _LuceneIndexesMetadata_, _LuceneIndexesData_ and
_LuceneIndexesLocking_.

This is normally achieved by adding this piece of configuration to the
server xml:



This is equivalent to the following script:




To apply it to the server, save the script to a file, and run:


where CONTAINER is the id of the running container.

Everything that is applied using the CLI is automatically persisted in
the server, and to check what the script produced, use the command to
dump the config to a local file called _config.xml._


Check the file _config.xml_: it should contain all four caches created
via the CLI.


====  

====  Using an existent configuration file


Most of the time changing configuration at runtime is sufficient, but it
may be desirable to run the server with an existent xml, or change
configurations that cannot be applied without a restart. For those
cases, the easier option is to mount a volume in the Docker container
and start the container with the provided configuration.

This can be achieved with Docker's volume support. Consider an xml file
called _customConfig.xml_ located on a local folder _/home/user/config_.
The following command:


will create a volume inside the container at the
_/opt/jboss/infinispan-server/standalone/configuration/extra/_
directory, with the contents of the local folder _/home/user/config_.

The container is then launched with the entrypoint _extra/customConfig_,
which means it will use a configuration named _customConfig_ located
under the _extra_ folder relative to where the configurations are
usually located at
_/opt/jboss/infinispan-server/standalone/configuration_.

==== Conclusion


And that's all about custom configuration using the Infinispan Docker
image.

Stay tuned for the next post where we'll dive into multi-host clusters
with the Infinispan Docker image.
