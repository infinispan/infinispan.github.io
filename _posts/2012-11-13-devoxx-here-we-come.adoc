If you're interested in data grids and especially in general and
measuring data grids performance in particular then come to
http://www.devoxx.com/display/DV12/Measuring+performance+and+capacity+planning+in+Java-based+data+grids[my
presentation at this year's Devoxx].

Manik Surtani is getting funny (literally!) with a gig suggestively
named "http://www.devoxx.com/display/DV12/Manik+Surtani[Will you
Map/Reduce my cloud]" and Galder Zamarreno brings the
http://www.devoxx.com/display/DV12/Galder+Zamarreno[polyglot JBoss at

Cheers,

Mircea
