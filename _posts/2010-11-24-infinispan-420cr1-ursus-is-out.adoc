Hi,



4.2.CR1 code name "Ursus" has just been released! It contains
https://jira.jboss.org/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?projectId=12310799&version=12315362[multiple]
fixes and improvements, mainly on memcached server and rehashing when
cluster topology changes. The jgroups version was also
https://jira.jboss.org/browse/ISPN-710[upgraded to 2.11]. Another thing
that's worth mentioning is that the default port for HotRod server has
changed from 11311 to 11222
(https://jira.jboss.org/browse/ISPN-739[here's why]).

You can download it from
http://www.jboss.org/infinispan/downloads[here]. Please
http://community.jboss.org/en/infinispan?view=discussions[share] your
thoughts with us!



Cheers,

Mircea
