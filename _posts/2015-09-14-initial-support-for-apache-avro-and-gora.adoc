https://avro.apache.org/[Avro] and http://gora.apache.org/[Gora] are two
Apache projects that belong to the https://hadoop.apache.org/[Hadoop]
ecosystem. Avro is a data serialization framework that relies on JSON
for defining data types and protocols, and serializes data in a compact
binary format. Its primary use in Hadoop is to provide a serialization
format for persistent data, and a wire format for communication between
Hadoop nodes, and from client programs to the Hadoop services. Gora is
an open-source software framework that provides an in-memory data model
and persistence for big data. Gora supports persisting to column stores,
key/value stores or databases, and analyzing the data with extensive
Apache Hadoop MapReduce support.

As an effort to run Hadoop based applications atop Infinispan, the
LEADS EU FP7 project has developed an Avro
backend
(https://github.com/leads-project/infinispan-avro[infinispan-avro]) and
a Gora module
(https://github.com/leads-project/gora-infinispan[gora-infinispan]). The
former allows to store, retrieve and query Avro defined types via the
HotRod protocol. The latter allows Gora-based applications to use
Infinispan as a storage backend for their MapReduce jobs. In the current
state of the implementation, the two modules make use of Infinispan
8.0.0.Final, Avro 1.7.6 and Gora 0.6

*What’s in it for you Infinispan user*

There are several use cases for which you can benefit from those
modules.

* With Infinispan’s Avro support, you can decide to persist your data in
Infinispan using Avro’s portable format instead of Infinispan’s own
format (or Java serialization’s format). This might help you standardize
upon a common format for your data at rest. 
* If you use Apache Gora to store/query some of your data in, or even
out, of the Hadoop ecosystem, you can use Infinispan as the backend and
benefit Infinispan’s features that you come to know like data
distribution, partition handling, cross-site clustering. 
* The last use case is to run legacy Hadoop applications, using
Infinispan as the primary storage. For instance, it is possible to run
the Apache http://nutch.apache.org/[Nutch] web crawler atop Infinispan.
