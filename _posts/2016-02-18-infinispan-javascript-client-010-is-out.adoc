Over the past few months we've been working on a
https://github.com/infinispan/js-client[Javascript client] based on
Node.js which can talk to Infinispan Server instances and today we can
announce the first public release, version 0.1.0 which can easily be
installed with the following command:



$ npm install infinispan



The client is still under heavy development but here's a summary of its
current capabilities:


* Full CRUD operation support, e.g. put, get, remove, containsKey...etc.
* Compare-And-Swap operation support, e.g. putIfAbsent,
getWithVersion/getWithMetadata, replace, replaceWithVersion,
removeWithVersion...etc.
* Expiration with absolute lifespan or relative maximum idle time is
supported. This expiration parameters as passed as optional parameters
to create/update methods and they support multiple time units, e.g.
\{lifespan: '1m', maxIdle: '1d'}.
* Update and remove operations can optionally return previous values by
passing in\{previous: true} option.
* Bulk store/retrieve/delete operations are supported, e.g. putAll,
getAll, getBulk, getBulkKeys, clear...etc.
* Cache contents can be iterated over using the iterator method.
* Cache size can be determined using the size method.
* Remote cache listeners can be plugged using the addListener method,
which takes the event type (create, modify, remove or expiry) and the
function callback as parameter.

Sample code showing how to use the Infinispan Javascript client can be
found in the
https://github.com/infinispan/js-client/blob/master/README.md[client's
README file].



In future versions we'll be adding remote execution support as well as
cluster topology handling, including consistent-hash based request
routing.



If you're a Javascript user and want to store data remotely in
Infinispan Server instances, please give the client a go and tell us
what you think of it via our
https://developer.jboss.org/en/infinispan/content[forum], via our
https://issues.jboss.org/projects/ISPN[issue tracker] or via IRC on the
#infinispan channel on https://issues.jboss.org/projects/ISPN[Freenode].



Cheers,
