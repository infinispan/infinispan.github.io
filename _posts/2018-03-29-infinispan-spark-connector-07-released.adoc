A new version of connector that integrates Infinispan and Apache Spark
has just been released!

This release brings compatibility with Infinispan 9.2.x and Spark
2.3.0.

Also included a new feature that allows to create and delete caches on
demand, passing custom configurations when required. For more details,
please consult the
https://github.com/infinispan/infinispan-spark/blob/master/README.md#cache-lifecycle-control[documentation].

To quickly try the connector, make sure to check the
