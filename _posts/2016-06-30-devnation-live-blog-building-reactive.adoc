Last Tuesday I gave a talk at DevNation 2016 on building Reactive
Applications with Node.js and Red Hat JBoss Data Grid. The slides for it
will be uploaded to the DevNation site shortly, but for those who want
to play around with the application demoed in the talk, you can find the
code and instructions in
https://github.com/galderz/infinispan-events/tree/june16[this
repository].

The Red Hat Developers blog posted a review of the talk in this

== DevNation Live Blog: Building Reactive Applications with Node.js and Red Hat JBoss Data Grid

Posted by http://developers.redhat.com/blog/author/rctkv/[Rob

At DevNation, Red Hat’s Galder Zamarreño gave a talk with a live
demo, Building reactive applications with Node.js and Red Hat JBoss Data
Grid. The demo consisted of building an event-based three tier web
application using JBoss Data Grid (JDG) as the data layer, an event
manager running on Node.js, and a web client. Recently, support for
Node.js clients was added to JDG, opening up the performance of a
horizontally scalable in-memory data grid, to reactive web and mobile
applications.

JDG is capable of processing and storing real-time streams of data,
while maintaining very fast response times. It does this by using the
memory available from a dynamically scalable grid of machines. Galder
described JDG as a four-in-one package capable of being:

* a distributed cache.
* a high performance NoSQL primary data store.
* an event-driven data store, particularly for real time event
processing.
* a big data and Internet of Things (IoT) data store.

The three-tiered web app in the demo consisted of:

* A web client written in Elm, which is a functional language that
compiles to JavaScript.  It is statically typed, which the presenter
feels leads to well architected code. Elm competes with platforms such
as React and Angular. Any of those other platforms could be used, but
Galder chose Elm for the live demo, particularly given the useful error
messages the compiler generates as a virtue of using a statically typed
language.
* An event manager running on Node.js using Express.js.
* JBoss Data Grid as the data store.  Three nodes were used, running on
the same laptop. Each element was guaranteed to be stored in two nodes,
providing redundancy for fail over.

Node.js based applications have become very popular. Many use JavaScript
on all three tiers, including NoSQL data stores. However, most of those
data stores can’t match the scalability and response times of JDG.
Traditionally, developers have needed to use Java to take advantage of
JBoss Data Grid. The new fully asynchronous Node.js interface to JBoss
Data Grid should enable developers to build some truly interesting
next-generation reactive applications.
