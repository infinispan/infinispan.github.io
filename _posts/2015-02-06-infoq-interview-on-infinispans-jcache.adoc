As
https://infinispan.org/blog/2014/12/infinispan-702final-is-certified-jsr.html[indicated
back in December 2014], Infinispan provides a JSR-107 certified JCache
implementation. Recently I caught up with Ben Evans from InfoQ to talk
about Infinispan, the certification and other topics. You can find the
interview http://www.infoq.com/news/2015/02/InfinispanJCache[here].

Cheers,
Galder
