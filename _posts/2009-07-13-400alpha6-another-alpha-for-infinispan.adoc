Yes, we've felt the need for one more Alpha. This alpha contains a
number of bug fixes over Alpha5, as well as some new minor features.
Please have a look at the
https://jira.jboss.org/jira/secure/ConfigureReport.jspa?versions=12313761&sections=.1.7.2.4.10.9.8.3.12.11.5&style=none&selectedProjectId=12310799&reportKey=pl.net.mamut%3Areleasenotes&Next=Next[release
notes] for details.

In addition to code changes, Vladimir Blagojevic has contributed a
Doclet to generate a configuration reference. Check this out
http://infinispan.sourceforge.net/4.0/apidocs/config.html[here]. While
not all config elements are properly annotated in this release - and as
such the configuration reference is somewhat sparse - thanks to this
tool, a more complete and up-to-date configuration reference is
something you can look forward to in future releases.

Further, Alejandro Montenegro has started compiling steps for an
http://www.jboss.org/community/wiki/Infinispaninteractivetutorial[interactive
tutorial]. Making use of a Groovy shell, this tutorial guides readers
through most of Infinispan's APIs in an interactive manner that would
hopefully make it easy to learn about Infispan. Please do give this a
try and provide Alejandro with feedback!

Please http://www.jboss.org/infinispan/downloads[download] and try out
this release, and

with your thoughts and experiences!

Cheers
