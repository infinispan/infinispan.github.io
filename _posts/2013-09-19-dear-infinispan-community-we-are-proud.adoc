Dear Infinispan community,

We are proud to announce the first Beta release of Infinispan 6.0.0.
This is an important milestone in the 6.0.0 lifecycle: it is feature and
API complete.

Included in this release, you can find:

* a complete implementation of the remote-query functionality, including
https://issues.jboss.org/browse/ISPN-3172[index management through
JMX ].  Adrian Nistor will blog on this in the following days
* https://issues.jboss.org/browse/ISPN-3051[allow configuring] the
number of segments per node allows one to configure an uneven load of
data between the nodes int the cluster. Dan Berindei will add a blog on
this shortly

Together with this release we're also launching our
http://infinispan.org/[new website]:

*  Built with Awestruct.  Yes, it really is awesome and fun to use
*  Hosted on https://github.com/infinispan/infinispan.github.io[GitHub
Pages].  Quick and easy.
*  Styled with JBoss.org Community's flavour of Twitter
https://github.com/jbossorg/bootstrap-community[Bootstrap] 
*  Documentation reformatted/moved from
https://github.com/infinispan/infinispan/tree/5.3.x/documentation[Confluence
to AsciiDoc] 

Among other things, the new site reflects some changes in the way
Infinispan http://infinispan.org/download/[is distributed] - including
http://infinispan.org/cache-store-implementations/[several cache stores]
and http://infinispan.org/hotrod-clients/[Hot Rod clients] being moved
out to separate GitHub repositories and following their own release
cycles. 

We think it's pretty slick and pretty sure you wouldn't guess its
written by a hardcore backed developer! Kudos to Manik Surtani for such
a nice job!



Last but certainly not least,  a BIG thanks to our colleagues from
the http://in.relation.to/Bloggers/HibernateSearch440Alpha2TheFastingBeforeTheCheese[Hibernate] team
for their support (that is enhancements, fixes and releases and
unreasonable hours) in getting the support needed for Infinispan's
remote query functionality in time!
