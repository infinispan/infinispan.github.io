We've been maintaining Spring integrations bits in Infinispan for quite
a while. Our development version, Infinispan 9, contains a set of
changes in those modules which deserve some explanation...



== Versions... versions everywhere...

When you use Infinispan, you rely on some, very specific version. The
same applies to Spring. Before Infinispan 9 our integration modules had
a compile-time dependency to a very specific version of Spring. In
practice, we imposed this specific version to each project which used
our integration bits. The question is - what to do to use some other
version of Spring or Spring Boot? Till Infinispan 9, the simplest
solution was to exclude Spring from _infinispan-spring4-embedded_ (or
_infinispan-spring4-remote_) artifact using
https://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-optional-and-excludes-dependencies.html[Maven
exclusions]. Not a very nice and intuitive solution was it?

== How about treating Spring as a Spec or API



You probably noticed, when you use JPA you don't care about underlying
implementation. Is it Hibernate, OpenJPA... it doesn't matter?



If you think carefully about Spring for a while, it's a bit similar. All
core classes might be delivered using standard dependency mechanism
(adding spring-beans, spring-context manually), using Spring Boot
(adding spring-boot-starter) or even using 3rd party integration tools
like DropWizard. In case of a bigger project, a decision whether or not
use any of those solutions needs to be taken long before Infinispan is
chosen as a Distributed Store or Cache.



At this point, we can do a mental experiment - treat Spring classes as a
Spec or API and those delivery mechanisms treat as implementations.

=== Scope? Provided, of course!



From Infinispan integration perspective we need the Spring API (the
classes) and we don't care about the implementation (delivery
mechanism). Having this in mind we
https://github.com/infinispan/infinispan/commit/76a584bce3566fd855a9629cb3ad9164461c3c45[decided
to change Spring's scope in Infinispan modules to provided].


=== I use Infinispan and Spring, what shall I do?



Starting from Infinispan 9, you can stop using exclusions. You probably
already use Spring and your favorite delivery mechanism (Spring Boot for
example). Then add _infinispan-spring4-embedded_ or
_infinispan-spring4-remote_ artifact. Finally, you need to decide how
would you like to use Infinispan - via Uber Jars (_infinispan-embedded_
and _infinispan-remote_) or using Small Jars (_infinispan-core_ for
example).



That's it! Have fun!
