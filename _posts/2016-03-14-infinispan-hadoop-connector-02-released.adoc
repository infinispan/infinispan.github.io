The https://github.com/infinispan/infinispan-hadoop[Infinispan Hadoop
connector] allows to read and write to Infinispan Server using Hadoop
compatible InputFormat and OutputFormat interfaces.

This release includes support for Infinispan 8.2.0.Final and brings
fixes to the failover capability, to guarantee that reads and writes can
occur even when nodes leave the cluster.
