I will be speaking at a number of JUGs around Europe this month. In
addition, other core Infinispan devs will also be making JUG and
conference appearances. I've put together a calendar of events which you
can track, or add to your Google calendar to monitor.

This is a great chance for folks to learn about Infinispan, cloud and
distributed computing, and where the project is headed. Hope to see you
at one or more of these events!

Cheers
Manik
