I've just released the long-awaited first beta of Infinispan 4.2.0,
codenamed _Ursus_.  The blocker that's been keeping Ursus in Alpha for
so long - https://jira.jboss.org/browse/ISPN-180[ISPN-180] - is now
complete and ready for you to take out for a spin.  Thanks to the work
put in by Mircea and Vladimir, ISPN-180 adds support in the distribution
algorithm to detect whether Infinispan instances are co-located on the
same physical server (or even the same rack) and pick secondary owners
of data with this knowledge in mind. This helps ensure maximum
durability of data, so if physical machines - or even an entire rack -
were to fail, data is not lost.  For more details on ISPN-180, have a
look at http://community.jboss.org/wiki/ServerHinting[this wiki page]
which details its use.

The JOPR/RHQ plugin now works in multi cache manager environments
(https://jira.jboss.org/browse/ISPN-675[ISPN-675]) and thanks to
https://jira.jboss.org/browse/ISPN-754[ISPN-754], cache manager
instances can be easily identified when using the JOPR/RHQ management
GUI.  As a result of ISPN-754, JMX object names follow
http://java.sun.com/javase/technologies/core/mntr-mgmt/javamanagement/best-practices.jsp[best
practices] as set up by Sun/Oracle and so this means that object names
exported to JMX have changed from this version onwards. See
http://community.jboss.org/docs/DOC-14865[this wiki page] for detailed
information.

For a list of all fixes since Alpha5, have a look at the
https://jira.jboss.org/secure/ConfigureReport.jspa?atl_token=y7xdZj9voL&versions=12315564&sections=all&style=none&selectedProjectId=12310799&reportKey=org.jboss.labs.jira.plugin.release-notes-report-plugin:releasenotes&Next=Next[release
notes] in JIRA, and as always, download the release
http://www.jboss.org/infinispan/downloads[here], and let us know what
you think using
http://community.jboss.org/en/infinispan?view=discussions[the user
forums].

Onward to release candidate and final release phases!  :-)

Enjoy,
Manik
