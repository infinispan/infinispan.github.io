Much awaited, 4.2.1.FINAL, codenamed
_Ursus_, https://issues.jboss.org/secure/ConfigureReport.jspa?atl_token=5a9a03fc1b4d659ec8ab4ef54d826c0d94a70f75&versions=12315885&sections=all&style=none&selectedProjectId=12310799&reportKey=org.jboss.labs.jira.plugin.release-notes-report-plugin%3Areleasenotes&Next=Next[this
release contains] a number of bug fixes, stability improvements and
performance enhancements over the last release candidate, and over
4.2.0.FINAL.



I recommend anyone using any previous version of Infinispan upgrade to
this latest and greatest iteration, which was worked on extensively this
week - alongside a host of new features for 5.0.0.  Expect a beta on
5.0.0 to be out soon as well - lots of exciting stuff for people to play
with.



As usual, grab the release
https://sourceforge.net/projects/infinispan/files/infinispan/4.2.1.FINAL/[here],
(or if you use Maven,
http://www.jboss.org/infinispan/downloads[instructions here]) and
provide feedback

Enjoy
