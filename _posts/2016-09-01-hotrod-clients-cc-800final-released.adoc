Dear Infinispan community,
I'm glad to announce the Final release of the C++ and C# clients version
8.0.0.

You can find the download on the Infinispan web site:

http://infinispan.org/hotrod-clients/

Major new features for this release are:

* queries
* remote script execution
* asynchronous operation (C++ only)

plus several minor and internal updates that partially fill the gap
between C++/C# and the Java client.

Some posts about the 8 serie of the C++/C# clients have been already
published on this blog, you can recall them clicking through the list
below.
