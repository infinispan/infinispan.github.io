We've just released Infinispan Node.js Client version
https://www.npmjs.com/package/infinispan[0.4.0] which comes with
encrypted client connectivity via SSL/TLS (with optional TLS/SNI
support), as well as cross-site client failover.

Thanks to the encryption integration, Node.js Hot Rod clients can talk
to Hot Rod servers via an encrypted channel, allowing trusted client
and/or authenticated clients to connect. Check the
https://github.com/infinispan/js-client/tree/v0.4.0#encryption[documentation]
for information on how to enable encryption in Node.js Hot Rod client.

Also, we've added the possibility for the client to connect to multiple
clusters. Normally, the client is connected to a single cluster, but if
all nodes fail to respond, the client can failover to a different
cluster, as long as one or more initial addresses have been provided. On
top of that, clients can manually switch clusters using switchToCluster
and switchToDefaultCluster APIs. Check
https://github.com/infinispan/js-client/tree/v0.4.0#working-with-sites[documentation]
for more info.

On top of that, we've applied several bug fixes that further tighten the
inner workings of the Node.js client.

If you're a Node.js user and want to store data remotely in Infinispan
Server instances, please give the client a go and tell us what you think
of it via our https://developer.jboss.org/en/infinispan/content[forum],
via our https://issues.jboss.org/projects/HRJS[issue tracker] or via IRC
on the #infinispan channel on Freenode.
