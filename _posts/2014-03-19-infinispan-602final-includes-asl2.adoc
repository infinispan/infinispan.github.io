We've just released Infinispan 6.0.2.Final to address a licensing issue
we were having with JBoss Marshalling. Infinispan switched to ASL2
license when Infinispan 6.0.0 was released, but one of its dependencies,
JBoss Marshalling, was still licensed under LGPL. JBoss Marshalling
1.4.4.Final, included in Infinispan
6.0.2.Final, https://github.com/dmlloyd/jboss-marshalling/blob/master/LICENSE.txt[has
been licensed under ASL2].

The release can be found in the usual places.

Cheers,
Galder
