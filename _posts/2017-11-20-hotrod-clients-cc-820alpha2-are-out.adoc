Dear Infinispanners,

we're pleased to announce the C++ and C# 8.2.0.Alpha2 releases.

Code for continuous queries (CQ) and SASL is almost complete. Worth
mentioning improvements for Alpha2 are:

* added xunit framework for build verification testing (googletest)
* CQ for C#
* EXTERNAL mech for SASL on windows (C++ and C#)
* more bugs resolved than added :)


Check the
