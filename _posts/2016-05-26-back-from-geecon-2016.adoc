Thanks to everyone who attended the Distributed Streams with Infinispan
talk at GeeCON 2016!! It was a blast to give the talk and although there
was a small hiccup with one of the demos, I managed to fix it and the
both demos were successfully delivered. The code from the demos can be
found in https://github.com/galderz/distributed-streams[this git
repository], and the slides can be found
https://speakerdeck.com/galderz/distributed-java-streams-with-infinispan[here].

I presented at GeeCON back in 2011 and it was great to be back once
again! The organizers keep doing an amazing job and can't wait to come
back. I particularly enjoyed how GeeCON was embracing other programming
languages outside the Java Virtual Machine. For example, there were
talks on Julia and Elm programming languages, both of which were superb
and I really enjoyed them :).

As always I could not attend all the talks I wanted to but heard good
things about Tomer's "How Shit Works: Storage" and Martin Thompson's
final "Top 10 Performance Mistakes" keynote. I hope to catch those when
the videos are released.

Hope to come back to GeeCON next year! :)

Cheers,
Galder
