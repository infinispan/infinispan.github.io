Hi all, as most of you know Infinispan has supported several protocols
(HotRod, Memcached, REST, WebSocket) to expose caches to remote
clients.

Traditionally these servers have been packaged in Infinispan's
distribution with a simple shell script to demonstrate how they should
be started (apart from the RESTful server which was packaged as a WAR
file).

Since the release of
http://infinispan.blogspot.it/2013/04/infinispan-530alpha1-is-out.html[Infinispan
5.3.0.Alpha1] we now have a proper distribution for these servers based
around a stripped-down JBoss AS 7.2.0 server. What you get is robust
support for all of the collateral services needed by the servers (JDBC
Datasources, Transactions, Security, Logging, etc) and a solid platform
for exposing your remote caches. Because the Infinispan Server only
contains the essential services required by the server endpoints, it is
not a full-fledged JEE application server, i.e. it cannot be used to
deploy applications or host other services.

To get started with the Infinispan Server, grab yourself the
http://downloads.jboss.org/infinispan/5.3.0.Alpha1/infinispan-server-5.3.0.Alpha1-bin.zip[distribution],
unpack it and use the provided bin/standalone.sh or standalone.bat
depending on your operating system.
The server should come up with HotRod, Memcached and REST endpoints. 

The easiest to try out is the REST endpoint using the provided web-based
console available on http://localhost:8080. Please also note that by
default the REST server is protected using BASIC HTTP authentication.
You should use the provided *add-user.sh* or *add-user.bat* scripts,
depending on your platform, to add valid users as follows:

*bin/add-user.sh*

What type of user do you wish to add?
 a) Management User (mgmt-users.properties)
 b) Application User (application-users.properties)
(a): *b*

Enter the details of the new user to add.
Realm (ApplicationRealm) :
Username : *user*
Password :
Re-enter Password :
What roles do you want this user to belong to? (Please enter a comma
separated list, or leave blank for none)[  ]: *REST*
About to add user 'user' for realm 'ApplicationRealm'
Is this correct yes/no? *yes*
Added user 'user' to file
'infinispan-server-5.3.0.Alpha1/standalone/configuration/application-users.properties'
Added user 'user' with roles REST to file
'infinispan-server-5.3.0.Alpha1/standalone/configuration/application-roles.properties'
Is this new user going to be used for one AS process to connect to
another AS process?
e.g. for a slave host controller connecting to the master or for a
Remoting connection for server to server EJB calls.
yes/no? *no*

Now open the console by clicking on the [+] in the bottom left corner of
your browser window and the following form should appear:

Type the following commands:

PUT /rest/default/a a

Authenticate using the user/password combination you created above and
the server should respond with a [200] Success message. In the above
command, rest is the name of the endpoint (you can have multiple
endpoints pointing to different cache managers or with different
security levels), default is the name of the cache and a is the key. The
second a is the value you want to associate with the key.
Now retrieve the value using the following command:

GET /rest/default/a

which should respond with a [200] a message. The console supports the
various PUT, GET, DELETE, POST, HEAD methods as well as some basic HELP
and is capable of recalling history using the up and down arrows.

During the course of the Infinispan 5.3.0 cycle we will be adding
documentation and features, so stay tuned and if you have any feedback
