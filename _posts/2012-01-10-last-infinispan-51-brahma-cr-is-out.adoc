First of all, happy new year to all the Infinispan community!

The final CR of the Infinispan 5.1 'Brahma' series, called 5.1.0.CR3 is
http://www.jboss.org/infinispan/downloads[out] with another round of
http://goo.gl/lMyin[fixes]. This will be the last of the candidate
releases and we expect to go final with the release very shortly, so
your help now is crucial. If you're using the last of our stable
releases, 5.0.1.FINAL, please upgrade to 5.1.0.CR3 and
http://community.jboss.org/en/infinispan?view=discussions[let us know]
if you encounter any issues.

Cheers,
Galder
