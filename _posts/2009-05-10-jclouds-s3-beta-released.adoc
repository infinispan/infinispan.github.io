http://code.google.com/p/jclouds/[jclouds]-s3 is the glue between
Infinispan and Amazon S3. jclouds provides a cachestore plugin that
allows you to persist your infinispan cluster to S3.

Over the last few months, jclouds has evolved with Infinispan's
concurrent context.

Under the hood, jclouds is made for infinispan. Its non-blocking engine
and FutureCommand design were crafted to meet the challenge of
Infinispan's grueling integration tests.

jclouds-s3 is also quite user-friendly, exposing services to S3 in a
simple Map interface.

As we are now in beta, please do try out jclouds-s3 and let us know
where we can improve. If you have some spare cycles, feel free to lend a
hand :)

Regardless, we hope you enjoy the product.
