Starting with Hibernate 4.0.0.Beta1, Infinispan second level cache
interacts with the transaction manager as a JTA Synchronization instead
of an XA resource. Based on some testing we've done in JBoss AS 7, this
has resulted in a huge performance increase
http://community.jboss.org/wiki/InfinispanTransactions#Enlisting_Synchronization[thanks
to the optimisations the transaction manager can apply] to
Synchronizations, which work very well when Infinispan is used as a
cache rather than as a authoritative data store.



From an Infinispan configuration perspective, nothing needs changing.
The Infinispan provider still uses the same
https://github.com/hibernate/hibernate-core/blob/master/hibernate-infinispan/src/main/resources/org/hibernate/cache/infinispan/builder/infinispan-configs.xml[base
configuration] by default. Transactional configuration happens within
the cache provider itself and it's here where the Infinispan is
configured with Hibernate's transaction manager and where Infinispan is
configured to participate as a JTA synchronization. This is the default
configuration, so from an user perspective, there's nothing you have to
do to take advantage of this new change.



However, you can always switch back to previous behaviour where
Infinispan interacted as an XA resource via a dedicated Hibernate
property called _hibernate.cache.infinispan.use_synchronization_

_
_

By default this property is set to _true_. If you set it _false_,
Infinispan will interact with the transaction manager as an XA resource.



For more detailed information, check the
"http://community.jboss.org/docs/DOC-14105[Using Infinispan As JPA
Hibernate Second Level Cache Provider]" wiki.
