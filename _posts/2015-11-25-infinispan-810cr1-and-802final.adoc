Dear all,

we have two releases for you today:

Infinispan 8.1.0.CR1 brings more refinement to the server management
console, many improvements to query, statistics, management, security
improvements and more.

Infinispan 8.0.2.Final brings a number of stabilization bug fixes.
Upgrading is highly recommended.

You can get both releases from our
http://infinispan.org/download/[download page]. If you are new to
Infinispan you can http://infinispan.org/tutorials/[learn] how to use
it, and http://infinispan.org/getinvolved/[help] us continually improve
it.
