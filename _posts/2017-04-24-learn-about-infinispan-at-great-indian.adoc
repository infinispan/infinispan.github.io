I've just arrived in India where I'll be speaking about Infinispan,
JBoss Data Grid and other related technologies in the
http://www.developermarch.com/developersummit/[Great Indian Developer
Developer Summit] in Bangalore. So if you're attending and want to find
out more how Infinispan can help your systems react to real-time data
quickly, and see the cool stuff we have for data analytics, make sure
you come!!
