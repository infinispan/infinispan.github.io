Dear Infinispanners,

we're pleased to announce the C++ and C# 8.2.0.Alpha1 release.

This is the first step on the 8.2 roadmap, which is not formally defined
in a Jira at the moment but will surely include: SASL authentication,
continuous queries, cluster counters.

In this release you can try and enjoy an Alpha version of the SASL
authentication, sample code is here
(https://github.com/infinispan/cpp-client/blob/8.2.0.Alpha1/test/SimpleSasl.cpp[C++],
https://github.com/infinispan/dotnet-client/blob/8.2.0.Alpha1/src/test/cs/Infinispan/HotRod/AuthenticationTest.cs[C#]).
Tell us what you think!
