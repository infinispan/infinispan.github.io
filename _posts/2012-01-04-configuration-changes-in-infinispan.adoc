This blog will introduce both Infinispan users, and Infinispan
contributors to the new configuration system. First, I'll detail the
changes for users, and then for committers.


== Users


If you use XML to configure Infinispan, you shouldn't notice any change,
except a much faster startup, courtesy of the Stax based parser.
However, if you use programmatic configuration, read on for the
important differences.
Configuration is now packaged in `org.infinispan.configuration`, and you
must use a builder style:

[source,java]
----
Configuration c1 = new ConfigurationBuilder()
   // Adjust any configuration defaults you want
   .clustering()
      .l1()
         .disable()
      .mode(DIST_SYNC)
      .hash()
         .numOwners(5)
   .build();
----

The old bean style configuration is now deprecated and will be removed
in a later version.
Configuration properties which can be safely changed at runtime are
mutable, and all others are immutable.
To copy a configuration, use the `read()` method on the builder, for
example:

[source,java]
----
Configuration c2 = new ConfigurationBuilder()
   // Read in C1 to provide defaults
   .read(c1)
   .clustering()
      .l1()
         .enable()
   // This cache is DIST_SYNC, will have 5 owners, with L1 cache enabled
   .build();
----

This completely replaces the old system of defining a set of overrides
on bean properties. Note that this means the behaviour of Infinispan
configuration is somewhat different when used programmatically. Whilst
before, you could define a default configuration, and any overrides
would be applied on top of *your* defaults when defined, now you must
explicitly read in your defaults to the builder. This allows for much
greater flexibility in your code (you can have a as many "default"
configurations as you want), and makes your code more explicit and type
safe (finding references works).

The schema is unchanged from before. Infinispan 4.0 configurations are
currently not being parsed. Support for these will be added shortly,
however a warning message will be printed if they are used. To upgrade,
just change the schema definition from:

[source,xml]
----
<infinispan
     xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
     xsi:schemaLocation="urn:infinispan:config:4.1 http://www.infinispan.org/schemas/infinispan-config-4.1.xsd"
     xmlns="urn:infinispan:config:4.1">
----

to

[source,xml]
----
<infinispan
     xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
     xsi:schemaLocation="urn:infinispan:config:5.1 http://www.infinispan.org/schemas/infinispan-config-5.1.xsd"
     xmlns="urn:infinispan:config:5.1">
----

The schema documentation has changed format, as it is now produced using
the standard tool x3p. This should be a significant improvement, as
better navigation is offered. Some elements and attributes are missing
docs right now, we are working on adding this. As an added benefit, your
IDE should now show documentation when an xsd referenced (as above)

We are in the process of adding in support for this configuration style
for modules (such as cache stores). In the meantime, please use the old
configuration or XML if you require support for cache store module
configuration.


== Committers


If you are a committer to Infinispan, you may find the following notes
useful. Note that currently we still use the old configuration system
internally within Infinispan. This makes things a little complicated.
This will be switched out soon! For now, you need to also add your
property to the old config system as well as the new.

Note, these guides assume you are adding an element to the cache
configuration, but apply equally to the global configuration.

Before you start adding a configuration property, identify whether you
want to add a property to an existing configuration group/element, or
whether you need to create a child object. We call the configuration
group XXX in the steps below.


=== Adding a property

. Add the property to the relevant `XXXConfiguration` class. Add a
private final field, add a parameter to the constructor, and assign the
value to the field in the constructor body. Add a accessor for the
property. If the property should be mutable at runtime, then add a
mutator as well. Most configuration properties are not mutable at
runtime - if the configuration is runtime mutable, then Infinispan needs
to take notice of this update whilst the cache is running (you can't
cache the value of the configuration in your implementation class).
Mutators and accessors don't use the classic JavaBean pattern of
prepending accessors with "get" and mutators with "set". Instead, the
name of the property is used for an accessor. A mutator is an overloaded
version of the accessor which takes a parameter, the new value.
. Add the property to the matching `XXXConfigurationBuilder`. You'll
need to add a mutable field to the class, and initialise it to it's
default value in the field declaration. Add a mutator (following the
above pattern).
. The `create()` method is called by the parent object in order to
instantiate the `XXXConfiguration` object from the builder. Therefore,
make sure to pass the value of the field in the builder to the
`XXXConfiguration` object's constructor here. Additionally, if you
require a complex default (for example, the value of a configuration
property is defaulted conditionally based on the value of some other
configuration property), then this is the place to do this.
. The `validate()` method is called by the parent object to validate the
values the user has passed in. This method may also be called directly
by user code, should they wish to manually validate a configuration
object. You should place any validation logic here related to your
configuration property. If you need to "cross-validate" properties
(validate the value of your property conditionally upon the value of
another property), and the other property is on another builder object,
increase the visibility of that other property field to "default", and
reference it from this builder, by calling the `getBuilder()` method,
which will gives you a handle on the root configuration builder.
. The final step is to add parsing logic to the `Parser` class. First,
add the attribute to name to the `Attribute` enum (this class simply
provides a mapping between the non-type-safe name of the attribute in
XML and a type-safe reference to use in the parser). Locate the relevant
`parseXXX()` method on the class, and add a case to the switch statement
for the attribute. Call the builder mutator you created above,
performing any XML related validation (you are unlikely to need this),
and type conversion (using the static methods on the primitive wrapper
classes, String class, or relevant enum class).

=== Adding a group


In some situations you may additionally want to add a configuration
grouping object, represented in XML as an element. You might want to do
this if you are adding a new area of functionality to Infinispan.
Identify the location of the new configuration grouping object. It might
be added to the root `Configuration` object, or it might be added to one
it's children, children's children. We'll call the parent YYY in the
steps below.

. Create the `XXXConfiguration` object. Add any properties required
following the guide for adding properties. The constructors visibility
should be "default".
. Create the `XXXConfigurationBuilder` object. It should subclass the
relevant configuration child builder -- use the
`YYYConfigurationChildBuilder` as the superclass. This will ensure that
all builder methods that allow the user to "escape" are provided
correctly (i.e provide access to other grouping elements), and also
require you to provide a create() and validate() method. The constructor
needs to take the the `YYYConfigurationBuilder` as an argument, and pass
this to the superclass (this simply allows access to the root of the
builder tree using the `getBuilder()` method).
. Follow the property adding guide to add any properties you need to the
builder. The `create()` method needs to return a new instance of the
`XXXConfiguration` object. Implement any validation needed in the
`validate()` method.
. In the `YYYConfiguration` object, add your new configuration class as
a private final field, add an accessor, and add initialiser assignment
in the constructor
. In the `YYYConfigurationBuilder`, add your new configuration builder
as a private final field, and initialise it in the constructor with a
new instance. Finally, add an accessor for it following the standard
pattern discussed in the guide.
. In the `YYYConfigurationBuilder` ensure that your validate method is
called in it's validate method, and that result of the
`XXXConfiguration` instances' create method is passed to the constructor
of `YYYConfiguration`
. Finally, add this to the parser. First, add the element to the
`Element` class, which provides a type safe representation of the
element name in XML. In the `Parser` class, add a new `parseXXX` method,
copying one of the others that most matches your requirements (parse
methods either parse elements only - look for
`ParseUtils,requireNoAttributes()`, attributes only -- look for
`ParseUtils.requireNoContent()` or a combination of both -- look for an
iterator over both elements and attributes). Add any attributes as
discussed in the adding a property guide. Finally, wire this in by
locating the `parseYYY()` method, and adding an element to the switch
statement, that calls your new `parseXXX()` method.

=== Bridging to the old configuration


Until we entirely swap out the old configuration you will need to add
your property to the old configuration (no need to worry about jaxb
mappings though!), and then add some code to the
`LegacyConfigurationAdaptor` to adapt both ways. It's fairly
straightforward, just locate the relevant point in the `adapt()` method
(near the configuration group you are using) and map from the legacy
configuration to the new configuration, or vs versa. You will need to
map both ways, in both adapt methods.
