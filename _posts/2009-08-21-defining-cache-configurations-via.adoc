Infinispan's first beta release is just around the corner and in
preparation, I'd like to introduce to the Infinispan users an important
API change in org.infinispan.manager.CacheManager class that will be
part of this beta release.

As a result of the development of the Infinispan second level cache
provider for Hibernate, we have discovered that the CacheManager API for
definition and retrieval of Configuration instances was a bit limited.
So, for this coming release, the following method has been deleted:

[source,java]
----
void defineCache(String cacheName, Configuration configurationOverride)
----


And instead, the following two methods have been added:

[source,java]
----
Configuration defineConfiguration(String cacheName, Configuration configurationOverride);
Configuration defineConfiguration(String cacheName, String templateCacheName, 
   Configuration configurationOverride);
----


The primary driver for this change has been the development of the
Infinispan cache provider, where we wanted to enable users to configure
or override most commonly modified Infinispan parameters via hibernate
configuration file. This would avoid users having to modify different
files for the most commonly modified parameters, hence improving
usability of the Infinispan cache provider. However, to be able to
implement this, we needed CacheManager's API to be enhanced so that:

- Existing defined cache configurations could be overriden. This enables
use cases like this: Sample Infinispan cache provider configuration will
contain a generic cache definition to be used for entities. Via
hibernate configuration file, users could redefine the maximum number of
entries to be allowed before eviction kicks in for all entities. The
code would look something like this:

[source,java]
----
// Assume that 'cache-provider-configs.xml' contains 
// a named cache for entities called 'entity'
CacheManager cacheManager = new DefaultCacheManager(
   "/home/me/infinispan/cache-provider-configs.xml");
Configuration overridingConfiguration = new Configuration();
overridingConfiguration.setEvictionMaxEntries(20000); // max entries to 20.000
// Override existing 'entity' configuration so that eviction max entries are 20.000.
cacheManager.defineConfiguration("entity", overridingConfiguration);
----


- Be able to define new cache configurations based on the configuration
of a given cache instance, optionally applying some overrides. This
enables uses cases like the following: A user wants to define eviction
wake up interval for a specific entity which is different to the wake up
interval used for the rest of entities.

[source,java]
----
// Assume that 'cache-provider-configs.xml' contains 
// a named cache for entities called 'entity'
CacheManager cacheManager = new DefaultCacheManager(
   "/home/me/infinispan/cache-provider-configs.xml");
Configuration overridingConfiguration = new Configuration();
// set wake up interval to 240 seconds
overridingConfiguration.setEvictionWakeUpInterval(240000L);
// Create a new cache configuration for com.acme.Person entity 
// based on 'entity' configuration, overriding the wake up interval to be 240 seconds
cacheManager.defineConfiguration("com.acme.Person", "entity", overridingConfiguration);
----


Another limitation of the previous API, which we've solved with this API
change, is that in the past the only way to get a cache's Configuration
required the cache to be started because the only way to get the
Configuration instance was from the Cache API. However, with this API
change, we can now retrieve a cache's Configuration instance via the
CacheManager API. Example:

[source,java]
----
// Assume that 'cache-provider-configs.xml' contains 
// a named cache for entities called 'entity'
CacheManager cacheManager = new DefaultCacheManager(
   "/home/me/infinispan/cache-provider-configs.xml");
// Pass a brand new Configuration instance without overrides 
// and it will return the given cache name's Configuration
Configuration entityConfiguration = cacheManager.defineConfiguration("entity", 
new Configuration());
----
