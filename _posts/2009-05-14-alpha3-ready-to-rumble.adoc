So I've just tagged and cut Infinispan 4.0.0.ALPHA3. (Why are we
starting with release 4.0.0?
http://www.jboss.org/community/wiki/InfinispanProjectFAQs[Read our
FAQs]!)

As I mentioned
http://infinispan.blogspot.com/2009/05/implementing-performant-thread-safe.html[recently],
I've implemented an uber-cool new asynchronous API for the cache and am
dying to show it off/get some feedback on it. Yes, Alpha3 contains the
async APIs. Why is this so important? Because it allows you to get the
best of both worlds when it comes to synchronous and asynchronous
network communications, and harnesses the parallelism and scalability
you'd naturally expect from a halfway-decent data grid. And, as far as I
know, we're the first distributed cache - open or closed source - to
offer such an API.

The release also contains other fixes, performance and stability
improvements, and better javadocs throughout. One step closer to a full
release.

Enjoy the release - available on our
http://www.jboss.org/infinispan/downloads[download page] - and please do
post feedback on the
http://www.jboss.org/infinispan/forums.html[Infinispan User Forums].

Cheers
Manik
