Dear Infinispanners,
C++ and C# 8.2.0.Beta1 releases are available!

These releases contain all the 8.2.0 features.

Worth a mention is the improvement in the remote execution API: we moved
the JBossMarshaller basic implementation from test to the distro in
order to simplify the data management on the application side. Test
examples
[https://github.com/infinispan/dotnet-client/blob/8.2.0.Beta1/src/test/cs/Infinispan/HotRod/RemoteTaskExecTest.cs[1]]
and
[https://github.com/infinispan/cpp-client/blob/8.2.0.Beta1/test/Simple.cpp[2]]
have been updated accordingly.

Next step will be a CR release containing improvements on API docs
(doxygen)

Check the
https://issues.jboss.org/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?projectId=12314125&version=12333563[release
notes], browse the source code
(https://github.com/infinispan/cpp-client/tree/8.2.0.Beta1[C++],
https://github.com/infinispan/dotnet-client/tree/8.2.0.Beta1[C#]) or
