Dear community,

We are proud to announce the release of Infinispan 8.2.0.Final.
http://infinispan.org/download#stable[Download it here]** **and try it
out!

This release is highlighted by performance improvements and multiple
fixes, and it introduces some new cool features. We emphasize the
following:


* New algorithm for remote reads in distributed mode that reduces the
network usage
* From now on, the consistent hash is shared among caches with the same
membership - entries in different caches using the same key will be
co-located
* A new lambda-enabled
http://infinispan.org/docs/8.2.x/user_guide/user_guide.html#_cluster_executor[Cluster
Executor] which does not require a clustered cache, but can be
constructed directly from a DefaultCacheManager.
* Protostream 3.0.5, Lucene 5.5, Hibernate Search 5.6.0.Alpha2
* And many tweaks and improvements overall.

Infinispan Server obviously deserves a list of its own:

Infinispan Server was gifted with a brand new event logger. Now it is
possible to check the last 7 days events like caches starting/stopping,
nodes join/leaving, task execution and security audits. In addition, it
is based on Wildfly 10.

Admin Console improvements

* Persistent login session which survives browser refresh
* Deployment / undeployment of user code
* Management of ProtoBuf schemas for indexing
* Management of Scripts for task execution
* Event viewing
* Much improved cache and template configuration
* Cache container configuration
* PatternFly 3.2

We are now preparing the next development cycle and we will introduce
new features and improvements. Stay tuned to know what is coming in
Infinispan 9.0.
