Dear community,

the new year brings a new release of the stable Infinispan branch.
Infinispan 7.0.3.Final is a bug-fix release with a particular focus on
partition handling stability. The release is a drop-in replacement for
previous 7.0.x releases, however, be aware that we reverted
org.infinispan.commons.utils.FileLookup to 6.0.x behaviour to ease
upgrade for Hibernate 2nd-level cache and WildFly. Sorry about the
breakage. Please consult the
https://issues.jboss.org/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?projectId=12310799&version=12326281[release
notes] for details.

Thanks to everyone involved in this release!Â
