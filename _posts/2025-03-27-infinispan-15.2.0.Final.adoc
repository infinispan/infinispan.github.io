= Infinispan 15.2.0.Final

*_"Feelin' Blue"_*

It's new.
It's blue.
It's Infinispan 15.2, codenamed https://untappd.com/b/three-sisters-brewery-feelin-blue/6087587["Feelin' Blue"].

Without further ado, here's a list of what's new (and I promise to stop with the Dr. Seuss rhyming):

== RESP endpoint
=== JSON

Infinispan now implements the https://redis.io/docs/latest/develop/data-types/json/[Redis JSON API].

=== Lua scripting

It is now possible to run https://redis.io/docs/latest/develop/interact/programmability/eval-intro/[Lua scripts].
The big advantage is that this works in Infinispan clusters, without having to worry about key ownership.

== Server

All endpoints limit the maximum request size, which defaults to `10MB`. This protects your server from abuse.
Use the `max-content-length` configuration attribute to change it to your liking.

== Metrics

You can now disable exporting the base (JVM) metrics, which is desirable when running in embedded mode.
Such metrics are usually exported by the application framework.

== Console

The console sports a new look & feel, thanks to the upgrade to https://www.patternfly.org/[PatternFly 6].

Manage roles, users and access control for Principal Role Mappers from the console.

== Fixes
Lots of these. However, should you find something that doesn't work, head over to our https://github.com/infinispan/infinispan/issues[issues] and provide any details that help us debug and solve problems.

== JDK requirements
Like the previous 15.x releases, you will need at least JDK 17 in order to use Infinispan 15.2. Infinispan also supports the recently released JDK 24.

== Deprecations and removals

We are no longer building the native server, since it did not provide the same level of functionality and performance as our Java server.
However, if you miss it, please let us know your use case, and we'll look into bringing it back.

== Documentation
Our documentation now includes
* https://infinispan.org/docs/stable/titles/metrics/metrics.html[a complete list of our OpenMetrics and JMX metrics]
* https://infinispan.org/docs/stable/logging/logs.html[a complete list of log messages]
As usual, many improvements, updates and fixes.

== Release notes

You can look at the https://github.com/infinispan/infinispan/releases/tag/15.2.0.Final[release notes] to see what was changed since our last development build.
