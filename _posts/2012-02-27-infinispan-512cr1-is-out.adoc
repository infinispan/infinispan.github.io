Based on community demand, we've decided to do another minor release in
the Infinispan 5.1 'Brahma' series and we've just released Infinispan
5.1.2.CR1.

This release includes fixes in the generated documentation, schema, and
by adding remote JMX monitoring options for all our demos, we've made it
easier to consume Infinispan out of the box.

Some important library upgrades such as JGroups have also been upgraded
and we've implemented more performance improvements, particularly around
state transfer.

Finally, we've added a new system property
(-Dinfinispan.unsafe.allow_jdk8_chm=true) which can be used to replace
internal Java's concurrent ConcurrentHashMap with the forthcoming
JDK8 ConcurrentHashMapV8 which is more memory efficient than the
current ConcurrentHashMap.

Full details of what has been fixed can be found
https://issues.jboss.org/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?projectId=12310799&version=12319011[here],
and if you have feedback, please visit
http://community.jboss.org/en/infinispan?view=discussions[our forums].
Finally, as always, you can download the release from
http://www.jboss.org/infinispan/downloads[here].

Cheers,
Galder
