Version 8 of the Infinispan C++ Hotrod Client implements the Execute on
Server (Exec) operation. This feature was introduced with Hotrod
protocol v 2.1 and has been described for the Java client
http://blog.infinispan.org/2015/10/stored-script-execution.html[here].

The user can now store the javascript code on the server then invoke it
when needed and let the server take care of the execution both locally
on the near node or distibuited on the whole cluster.

The following annotated code isÂ  an example of a C++ Exec that addresses
the following use case: the user wants to get a string value and wants
to count how many times it has been accessed from all the connected
clients.

You can git the whole source following this
