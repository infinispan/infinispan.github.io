http://g.oswego.edu/[Doug Lea] and the folks on the
http://altair.cs.oswego.edu/mailman/listinfo/concurrency-interest[concurrency-interest
group] have been hard at work on an update of
http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=166[JSR 166] (concurrency utilities) for
Java 8 - called
http://cs.oswego.edu/pipermail/concurrency-interest/2011-July/008084.html[JSR
166e].  These include some pretty impressive changes in a building-block
we've all come to rely pretty heavily on, the
http://docs.oracle.com/javase/1.5.0/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/ConcurrentHashMap.html[ConcurrentHashMap].

One if the big drawbacks in the ConcurrentHashMap, since it was
introduced in Java 5, has always been memory footprint.  It is kinda
bulky, especially when compared to a regular HashMap - 1.6 kb in memory
versus about 100 _bytes_!  Yes, these are for _empty_ maps.

In Java 8, one of the improvements in the ConcurrentHashMap has been
memory footprint - now closer to a regular HashMap.  In addition to
that, the new Java 8 CHM performs better under concurrent load when
compared to its original form.  See
http://concurrency.markmail.org/message/kbqxdfapp5n6u7j3?q=JDK8+CHM[this
discussion] and
http://gee.cs.oswego.edu/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/jsr166/src/jsr166e/ConcurrentHashMapV8.java?revision=1.37&view=markup[comments]
in the proposed ConcurrentHashMapV8 sources for more details.

So, http://www.jboss.org/infinispan/[Infinispan] makes pretty heavy use
of ConcurrentHashMaps internally.  One change in the recently released
http://infinispan.blogspot.com/2012/03/infinispan-512final-is-available-now.html[Infinispan
5.1.2.Final] is these internal CHMs are built using a factory, and we've
included a version of the Java 8 CHM in Infinispan.  So by default,
Infinispan uses the JDK's provided CHM.  But if you wish to force
Infinispan to use the backported Java 8 CHM, all you need to do is
include the following JVM parameter when you start Infinispan:

-Dinfinispan.unsafe.allow_jdk8_chm=true


We'd love to hear what you have to say about this, in terms of memory
footprint, garbage collection and overall performance.  Please use the
Infinispan

to provide your feedback.

Thanks
