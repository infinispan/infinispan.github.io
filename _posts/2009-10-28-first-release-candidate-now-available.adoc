Infinispan 4.0.0.CR1 is now available for download. This is an important
release, containing several critical bug fixes on the last beta.
Performance has improved too, with a better default JGroups stack. Many
thanks to the multitude of contributors and committers who have worked
hard to make this release a possibility.



A full change log is available on
https://jira.jboss.org/jira/secure/ConfigureReport.jspa?versions=12313671&sections=.1.7.2.4.10.9.8.3.12.11.5&style=none&selectedProjectId=12310799&reportKey=pl.net.mamut%3Areleasenotes&Next=Next[JIRA].

usual place. Please test this release with anger; feedback is critical
to a high-quality final release. The
