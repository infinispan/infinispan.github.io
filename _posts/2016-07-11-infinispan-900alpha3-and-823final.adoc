Dear Infinispan users,

As we have lately been releasing Infinispan 8 and 9 releases in pairs,
today's releases are no different. We have 9.0.0.Alpha3 and 8.2.3.Final
ready for you!

A new micro release of our stable 8.2 branch fixes 16 issues. If you are
using any other 8.x release, we recommend an upgrade to 8.2.3.Final as
this release contains latest bugfixes, performance improvements, and
Hibernate Search library update.

A brand new Alpha release from our development branch: 9.0.0.Alpha3 has
more than 50 bug fixes, and many enhancements, among which we single
out: improved distributed streams, documentation enhancements, admin
console improvements, and various component upgrades.
