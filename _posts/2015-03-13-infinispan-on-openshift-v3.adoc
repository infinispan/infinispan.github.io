Openshift v3 is the open source next generation of Paas, where
applications run on https://www.docker.com/[Docker] containers and are
orchestrated/controlled/scheduled by
http://kubernetes.io/[Kubernetes].

In this post I'll show how to create an Infinispan cluster on Openshift
v3 and resize it with a snap of a finger.


==== Installing Openshift v3

====  

Openshift v3 has not been released yet, so I'm going to use the code
from https://github.com/openshift/origin[origin].
There are
http://docs.openshift.org/latest/getting_started/installation.html[many
ways] to install Openshift v3, but for simplicity, I'll run a full
multinode cluster locally on top of VirtualBoxes using the provided
https://www.vagrantup.com/[Vagrant] scripts.

Let's start by checking out and building the sources:

To boot Openshift, it's a simple matter of starting up the desired
number of nodes:


Grab a beer while the cluster is being provisioned, after a while you
should be able to see 3 instances running:

==== Creating the Infinispan template


The following template defines a 2 node Infinispan cluster communicating
via TCP, and discovery done using the
http://www.jgroups.org/javadoc/org/jgroups/stack/GossipRouter.html[JGroups
gossip router]:



There are few different components declared in this template:


* A service with id _jgroups-gossip-service_ that will expose a JGroups
gossip router service on port 11000, around the
https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/gustavonalle/jgroups-gossip/[JGroups
Gossip container]
* A ReplicationController with id _jgroups-gossip-controller_.
Replication Controllers are used to ensure that, at any moment, there
will be a certain number of replicas of a pod (a group of related docker
containers) running. If for some reason a node crashes, the
ReplicationController will instantiate a new pod elsewhere, keeping the
service endpoint address unchanged.
* Another ReplicationController with id _infinispan-controller_. This
controller will start 2 replicas of the _infinispan-pod_. As it happens
with the _jgroups-pod_, the _infinispan-pod_ has only one container
defined: the infinispan-server container (based on
https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/jboss/infinispan-server/[jboss/infinispan-server])
, that is started with the 'clustered.xml' profile and configured with
the 'jgroups-gossip-service' address. By defining the gossip router as a
service, Openshift guarantees that environment variables such
as[.pl-s1]# JGROUPS_GOSSIP_SERVICE_SERVICE_HOST are# available to other
pods (consumers).




==== Applying the template



To apply the template via cmd line:


Grab another beer, it can take a while since in this case the docker
images need to be fetched on each of the minions from the public
registry. In the meantime, to inspect the pods, along with their
containers and statuses:




==== Resizing the cluster


Changing the number of pods (and thus the number of nodes in the
Infinispan cluster) is a simple matter of manipulating the number of
replicas in the Replication Controller. To increase the number of nodes
to 4:



This should take only a few seconds, since the docker images are already
present in all the minions.




And this concludes the post, be sure to check other cool features of
Openshift in the
http://docs.openshift.org/latest/welcome/index.html#[project
documentation] and try out other
