Dear Infinispan Community,

Today we continue with our time-boxed releases, this time on 9.2 release
branch! We prepared The Infinispan 9.2.0.Alpha1 for you. As usual, it
can be found on our download http://infinispan.org/download/[page].

9.2.0.Alpha1 brings Infinispan
https://github.com/infinispan/infinispan/blob/cb025dab181b9ebd16aa05512f641c39aa1fb84f/documentation/src/main/asciidoc/user_guide/multimapcache.adoc[MultimapCache]
- a new distributed and clustered collection type that maps keys to
values in which each key can contain multiple values. We rolled out
support for embedded cache mode, but upcoming releases will have support
for other Infinispan modes, including client invocation through
hotrod.

Aside from MultimapCache we also include the usual slew of bug fixes,
clean ups, and general improvements. Full details of the new features
and enhancements included in this release can be found
https://issues.jboss.org/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?version=12335605&projectId=12310799[here].

We have a lot more exciting features coming up on Infinispan 9.2 branch.
Thank you for following us and stay tuned!

The Infinispan Team
