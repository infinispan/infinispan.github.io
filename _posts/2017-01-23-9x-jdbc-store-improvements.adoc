Infinispan 9 introduces several changes to the JDBC stores, in
summary:

* Configuration of DB version
* Upsert support for store writes
* Timestamp indexing
* http://www.mchange.com/projects/c3p0/[c3p0] connection pool replaced
by https://github.com/brettwooldridge/HikariCP[HikariCP]



== DB Version Configuration



Previously when configuring a JDBC store it was only possible for a user
to specify the vendor of the underlying DB. Consequently, it was not
possible for Infinispan to utilise more recent features of DB as the SQL
utilised by our JDBC stores had to satisfy the capabilities of the
oldest supported DB version.

In Infinispan 9 we have completely refactored the code responsible for
generating SQL queries.  Enabling our JDBC stores to take greater
advantage of optimisations and features applicable to a given database
vendor and version. See the below gist for examples of how to specify
the major and minor versions of your database.

Programmatic config:

XML Config:

*Note*: If no version information is provided, then we attempt to
retrieve version data via the JDBC driver.  This is not always possible
and in such cases we default to SQL queries which are compatible with
the lowest supported version of the specified DB dialect.


=== Upsert Support


As a consequence of the refactoring mentioned above, writes to the JDBC
stores finally utilise upserts. Previously, the JDBC stores had to first
select an entry, before inserting or updating a DB row depending on
whether the entry previously existed.  Now, in supported DBs, store
writes are performed atomically via a single SQL statement.

In some cases it may be desirable for the previous store behaviour to be
utilised, in such cases the following property should be passed to your
store's configuration and set to true:
`infinispan.jdbc.upsert.disabled`.


=== Timestamp Indexing



By default an index is now created on the `timestamp-column` of a JDBC
store when the "create-on-start" option is set to true for a store's
table.  The advantage of this index is that it prevents the DB from
having to perform full table searches when purging a table of expired
cache entries.  Similar to upsert support, this index is optional an can
be disabled by setting the property `infinispan.jdbc.indexing.disabled`
to true.  



== Hello HikariCP



In Infinispan 9 we welcome HikariCP as the new default implementation
for the JDBC PooledConnectionFactory. HikariCP provides superior
performance to c3p0 (the previous default), whilst also providing a much
smaller footprint. The PooledConnectionFactoryConfiguration remains the
same as before, expect we now include the ability to explicitly define a
properties file where additional configuration parameters can be
specified for the underlying HikariCP. For a full list of the available
HikariCP configuration properties, please see
the https://github.com/brettwooldridge/HikariCP#configuration-knobs-baby[official
documentation]. 



*Note:* Support for c3p0 has been deprecated and will be removed in a
future release. However, users can force c3p0 to be utilised as before
by providing the system property `-Dinfinispan.jdbc.c3p0.force=true`.





== Summary


We have introduced the above new features to the JDBC stores in order to
improve performance and to enable us to further the store's capabilities
in the future. If you're a user of the JDBC stores and have any feedback
on the latest changes, or would like to request some new
features/optimisations, let us know via
