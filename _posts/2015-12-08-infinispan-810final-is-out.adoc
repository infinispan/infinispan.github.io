Dear all,



We are proud to announce the release of Infinispan 8.1.0.Final,
codenamed “Mahou”, the culmination of four months of active development.



This release brings many enhancements but most of all we would like to
highlight the new Infinispan Web Management Console which is finally
ready for prime time. We have gone through quite a few iterations in
UI/UIX design to make sure the majority of use case scenarios are
covered. In 8.2 release we are going to add further enhancements to
configuring and managing endpoints, server tasks, cache containers and
others. Until then, have a look, try it out and do not forget to provide
us with your feedback. As a teaser, we provide you with the following

admin console.
