Hello all,

Querying is an important feature for Infinispan, so we've decided to
include a technology preview of this for 4.0.0.CR1 and 4.0.0.GA, even
though it is only really scheduled for Infinispan 4.1.0.

Browse to http://www.jboss.org/community/wiki/QueryingInfinispan[this
wiki page] to see how the new API works for querying, along with usage
examples.#

# Origins#
Some of the API has come from
http://www.jboss.org/community/wiki/JBossCacheSearchable[JBoss Cache
Searchable] but has been enhanced and runs slicker. A lot more work is
being done under the hood so it makes it easier for users. For example,
the API method on the #QueryFactory.getBasicQuery()#
just needs two Strings and builds a basic Lucene
#Query# instance, as opposed to forcing the user to
create a Lucene query manually. This is still possible however, should a
user want to create a more complex query.

The indexing for Lucene is now done through interceptors as opposed to
listeners, and hence more tightly integrated into Infinispan's core.

You can also choose how indexes are maintained. If indexes are shared
(perhaps stored on a network mounted drive), then you only want nodes to
index changes made locally. On the other hand, if each node maintains
its own indexes (either in-memory on on a local filesystem) then you
want each node to index changes made, regardless of where the changes
are made. This behaviour is controlled by a system property -
-#Dinfinispan.query.indexLocalOnly=true.# However,
this is system property #temporary# and will be
replaced with a proper configuration property once the feature is out of
technology preview.

What's coming up?
Future releases of Hibernate Search and Infinispan will have
improvements that will change the way that querying works. The
QueryHelper class - as documented in the wiki - is temporary so that
will eventually be removed, as you will not need to provide the class
definitions of the types you wish to index upfront. We will be able to
detect this on the fly (see
http://opensource.atlassian.com/projects/hibernate/browse/HSEARCH-397[HSEARCH-397])

There will be a better system for running distributed queries. And the
system properties will disappear in favour of proper configuration
attributes.

And also, http://code.google.com/soc/[GSoC] student Lukasz Moren's work
involving an Infinispan-based Lucene Directory implementation will allow
indexes to be shared cluster-wide by using Infinispan itself to
distribute these indexes. All very clever stuff.
