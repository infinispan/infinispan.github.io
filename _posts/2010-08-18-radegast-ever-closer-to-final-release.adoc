As much as I expected 4.1.0.CR2 to be the last release candidate before
a final release, we've decided to release another candidate for you to
try out before pushing out a final release.  CR3 is now out and ready to
roll.

There has been a lot of activity in the Infinispan community over the
last 3 weeks, with lots of people putting CR2 through its paces, and
reporting everything from the
https://jira.jboss.org/browse/ISPN-605[trivial] through to the
https://jira.jboss.org/browse/ISPN-598[critical].  This is awesome
stuff, folks - keep it up!

This release has fixed a whole bunch of things you guys have reported.
 Many thanks to Galder, Mircea, Vladimir and Sanne, working hard around
vacations to get this release out.

Detailed release note reports are on
https://jira.jboss.org/secure/ConfigureReport.jspa?atl_token=F9IO-78sDp&versions=12315293&sections=.1.7.2.4.10.9.8.3.12.11.5&style=none&selectedProjectId=12310799&reportKey=org.jboss.labs.jira.plugin.release-notes-report-plugin:releasenotes&Next=Next[JIRA],
and it can be downloaded in the
http://www.jboss.org/infinispan/downloads[usual place].  Use the
http://community.jboss.org/en/infinispan?view=discussions[forums] and
report stuff - push this as hard as you've been pushing CR2 and we will
have that rock-solid final release we all want!

Enjoy!
Manik
