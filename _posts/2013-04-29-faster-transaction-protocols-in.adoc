The total order based protocol is a lock free commit protocol that
relies on the concept of totally ordered delivery of messages which,
informally, implies that each node which delivers a set of messages,
delivers them in the same order.

This protocol comes with this advantages.

. transactions can be committed in one phase, as they are delivered in
the same order by the nodes that receive them.
. it mitigates distributed deadlocks.

The weaknesses of this approach are the fact that its implementation
relies on a single thread per node which receives the transaction and
its modification from other nodes in the cluster, and the slightly
higher number of messages exchanged by JGroups.

Thus, this protocol delivers best performance in scenarios of *high
contention*, in which it can benefit from the single-phase commit and
the thread that delivers/applies transactions is not the bottleneck.

Currently, the Total Order based protocol is available only
in *transactional* caches for *replicated* and *distributed* modes and
it is available
in http://infinispan.blogspot.com.br/2013/04/infinispan-530alpha1-is-out.html[Infinispan
5.3.0 Alpha1].

If you are interested in know more, please take a look at the
https://docs.jboss.org/author/display/ISPN/Total+Order+based+commit+protocol[user
documentation] where it is explained in more detail how it behaves and
how you can configure it. Since this is a recent work, if you find any
incorrect behavior please create a
https://issues.jboss.org/issues/?jql=project%20%3D%20ISPN[JIRA].

Please find below some benchmarks comparing the total order based
implementation with the locking based implementation in two different
scenarios:

* *Contention*: 1000 keys in a *shared* pool, 8 threads per node and 5
writes (on average) per transaction;

* *No Contention*: 1000 keys in a thread *private* pool, 8 threads per
node and 5 writes (on average) per transaction.
