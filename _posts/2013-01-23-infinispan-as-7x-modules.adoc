The latest Infinispan 5.2.0.CR2 release includes a set of modules for
JBoss AS 7.x. By installing these modules, it is possible to deploy user
applications without packaging the Infinispan JARs within the
deployments (WARs, EARs, etc), thus minimizing their size. In order not
to conflict with the Infinispan modules which are already present within
an AS installation, the modules provided by the Infinispan distribution
are located within their own slot identified by the _major.minor_
versions (e.g. slot="5.2").
In order to tell the AS deployer that we want to use the Infinispan APIs
within our application, we need to add explicit dependencies to the
deployment's MANIFEST:

dependencies as _provided_ and configure your artifact archiver to
generate the appropriate MANIFEST.MF file:
