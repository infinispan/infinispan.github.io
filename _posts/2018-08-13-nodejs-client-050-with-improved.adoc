Infinispan Node.js client
https://www.npmjs.com/package/infinispan[0.5.0] was released last week.
It comes with much improved stability under heavy load conditions and
hence it's a recommended upgrade for any current users.

On top of that, a configuration option called topologyUpdates (*true
(default) */ false) has been added to disable topology updates. This can
be useful when trying to access Infinispan server running within a
Docker container on MacOs. Without this option to disable topology
updates, Node.js client receives internal Docker IP addresses on first
contact which cannot be accessed from outside Docker on MacOs. See
https://blog.infinispan.org/2018/03/accessing-infinispan-inside-docker-for.html[this
previous blog post] for more details.

If you're a Node.js user and want to store data remotely in Infinispan
server instances, please give the client a go and tell us what you think
of it via our https://developer.jboss.org/en/infinispan/content[forum],
via our https://issues.jboss.org/projects/HRJS[issue tracker] or via
https://zulipchat.com/[Zulip] on
https://infinispan.zulipchat.com/[Infinispan channel].

Cheers,
Galder
