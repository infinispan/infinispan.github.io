Yes, the much-awaited CR2 of Infinispan 4.2.1, codenamed "Ursus", is
finally out.  We've had excellent feedback on 4.2.0 and earlier betas
and CRs on 4.2.1, which has led to a large number of bugs fixed and
performance improvements implemented.  As always, this is much
appreciated, helps make Infinispan a stronger platform for the
community, and please do keep this up.  We'd love to hear what you have
to say about CR2.

Details of what's fixed is in the
