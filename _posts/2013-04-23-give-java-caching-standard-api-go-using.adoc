As part of the recent
http://infinispan.blogspot.com.br/2013/04/infinispan-server-530alpha1.html[Infinispan
5.3.0.Alpha1], the first
https://github.com/infinispan/infinispan/tree/5.3.0.Alpha1/jcache[Infinispan
JCache implementation] was released which implements version 0.6 of the
JCache specification as defined by
http://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=107[JSR-107]. It passes 100% the
mandatory TCK including optional transactions TCK.

A https://docs.jboss.org/author/x/IwHhAw[document on how to use
Infinispan JCache implementation] has just been released, which explains
the basics of using JCache, how it differs with existing APIs provided
by the JDK, and how to cluster JCache based cache instances. More
information will be added to the document, including quickstarts, as we
make further progress in the Infinispan 5.3 series.

Please note that the CDI and annotations part of JCache 0.6
specification is still in flux, and we're not yet able to provide an
implementation for it, but we expect the issues stopping the
implementation to be resolved in the near future.

Finally, as it's expected from first releases, some bugs might be
present, so if you encounter any misbehaviour, check
http://goo.gl/FquL1[the list of issues associated with the JCache
component] to see if the issue has already been resolved, or if not,
please report it so that it can be fixed ASAP :).

Cheers,
Galder
