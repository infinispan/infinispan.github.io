the past few months, I have been working with prominent technology
http://www.mastertheboss.com/[blogger] and
http://www.packtpub.com/authors/profiles/francesco-marchioni[author]
Francesco Marchioni on my first book ever.  Unsurprisingly, this is a
book on Infinispan, written for http://www.packtpub.com/[Packt
Publishing].

This is an entry-level book, covering high level concepts of distributed
caching and data grids, before diving into practical, hands-on details
of setting up, configuring and using Infinispan.  Monitoring a running
grid via
http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/tech/javamanagement-140525.html[JMX]
and http://www.jboss.org/rhq/[RHQ] are also covered, as is a chapter on
using Infinispan from
http://www.theserverside.com/news/1373391/Dependency-Injection-in-Java-EE-6-Part-1[CDI],
the increasingly popular programming model for enterprise Java.

Grab the book - in print or electronic format - from

website].
