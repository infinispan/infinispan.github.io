I'd like to welcome Infinispan's newest full-time core engineer, Trustin
Lee.  Trustin's no stranger to open source software, being the founder
and project lead of Apache MINA and Netty - the latter of which is used
in Infinispan's memcached and Hot Rod server endpoints.  Trustin will be
working on all things Infinispan, adding muscle to the core development
effort.  Trustin's based in Seoul, South Korea.

Welcome aboard, Trustin!  :)

Cheers
Manik
