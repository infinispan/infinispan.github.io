Dear Infinispan community,

it is with great pleasure that we are announcing the release of
Infinispan 8.0.0.Alpha2 as we continue forward.

This release brings a few very useful features:

* https://issues.jboss.org/browse/ISPN-5509[second batch for size-based
eviction]: sized based eviction has been updated to work when
storeAsBinary is enabled or if the cache only contains primitive wrapper
types (Integer, Long.. etc), Strings or byte[].
* https://issues.jboss.org/browse/ISPN-5219[entry iterator over HotRod]:
it is now possible to iterate over all the entries in a cache even in
distributed mode using HotRod.  This provides full consistency
guarantees under a rehash event (node goes up or down) and batches data
to help prevent memory issues on the client.
* non-indexed query over indexed cache with
https://issues.jboss.org/browse/ISPN-5519[compatiblity]
* first batch for infinispan core threading changes: we are improving
our thread utilization significantly with the 8.0 release cycle and we
already have reduced https://issues.jboss.org/browse/ISPN-5484[transport
thread usage] and added a configurable
https://issues.jboss.org/browse/ISPN-5518[thread pool for async
operations] to prevent internal thread pool exhaustion.  There will be
even more enhancements for this in future releases!
* and many many bugfixes, consult our issue tracker for a list of things
we have fixed.

done during the 8.0 cycle.
