Over the past few weeks, I've been
https://jira.jboss.org/jira/secure/IssueNavigator.jspa?reset=true&&fixfor=12314279&fixfor=12314154&fixfor=12313671&pid=12310799&resolution=1&component=12312424&assigneeSelect=issue_current_user&sorter/field=issuekey&sorter/order=DESC[working
on improving how Infinispan is managed and/or monitored] and I can
finally share some of the results of that effort with you.

In the coming weeks, I'll be sharing some in-depth flash movies
explaining everything from installing http://www.jboss.org/jopr[Jopr],
our enterprise management solution for JBoss middleware, to installing
the Infinispan Jopr plugin, discovering Infinispan instances
automatically or manually...etc

However, before that, I'd like to share a video demo with you where I
briefly show a three-node Infinispan cluster being monitored. It
demonstrates graphical measurements, and non-graphical information of
running Infinispan instances, addition or removal of monitored metrics
and finally, execution of management operations on a Infinispan
instance.




The Infinispan version used in the video was a snapshot of Infinispan
4.0.0, but you should be able to replicate what's shown in the video
with Infinispan 4.0.0.CR3 or higher.

Enjoy :)
