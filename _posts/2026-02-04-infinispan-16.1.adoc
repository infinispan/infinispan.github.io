= Infinispan 16.1

*_"Polly Want a Pilsner"_*

Infinispan 16.1 is here, and it is codenamed https://untappd.com/b/hop-city-brewing-co-polly-want-a-pilsner/1372902["Polly Want a Pilsner"].

It is the first release that follows link:/roadmap/[our time-boxed plan].

== Container-based eviction

Prior to this release, it was only possible to configure memory bounds for individual caches.

Infinispan 16.1 introduces the concept of bounded memory containers: configure a global container (you can have more
than one), and whether you want it to be bound by count or by memory and reference that container name in the cache
configuration.

The following diagram shows the difference between per-cache and container eviction

In the example below, the memory configuration for caches `a` and `b` combined will be bounded at `100MB`:

      <local-cache name="a">
          <memory eviction-container="max-size"/>
      </local-cache>

      <local-cache name="b">
          <memory eviction-container="max-size"/>
      </local-cache>
   </cache-container>

== OpenAPI / Swagger

Infinispan 10 introduced the `v2` REST endpoint which aimed to improve the original API and expand it with all the
requirements we added for data and system management. Unfortunately that API was designed in a way that made it
impossible to represent via an OpenAPI descriptor.

Infinispan 16.1 introduces a new `v3` REST API which *is* OpenAPI-compliant.

To try it out, start an Infinispan Server and point to http://127.0.0.1:11222/swagger-ui/

== Query and Lucene 10

Thanks to the work done by our friends over at https://hibernate.org/search/[Hibernate Search], Infinispan now supports
both Lucene 9 and 10.

== Infinispan Server

=== Server now requires Java 25

Our server image has already included Java 25 since 16.0, but we've now made this a hard requirement for bare metal
deployments too.
Don't worry: the clients can continue running with _ye olde_ legacy Java versions of choice.

=== Lucene 10.3
By requiring Java 25, the server can now include
https://lucene.apache.org/core/corenews.html#apache-lucenetm-1030-available[Lucene 10.3], which can leverage SIMD to
increase performance in several areas.

=== Pre-start batch scripts

The server can now automatically execute batch scripts before start.
This feature is primarily intended for our operator in order to prepare the server according to its configuration, but
it may also be useful for your own use-cases.

=== AOT cache in the container image

The server image now includes an https://openjdk.org/jeps/483[AOT cache] to reduce startup and warmup time.

== CLI batch error handling

The CLI has been enhanced to better report errors during batch execution: you can now decide to fail-fast, fail-at-end
or ignore batch errors altogether.

== Default mechanisms

Infinispan Server no longer enables weak/vulnerable authentication mechanisms by default: algorithms which use
`MD5` and `SHA-1` must be explicitly enabled if you want to keep using them.

== Backwards compatibility

Infinispan 16.1 is fully backwards compatible with 16.0 deployments.

== The next release

According to our link:/roadmap/[roadmap], our next release will be 16.2, and it will happen on 2026-06-03.
