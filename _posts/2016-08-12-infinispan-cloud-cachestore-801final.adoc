After bringing the MongoDB up-to-date a few days ago, this time it's the
turn of the Cloud Cache Store, our
https://jclouds.apache.org/[JClouds]-based store which allows you to use
any of the JClouds BlobStore providers to persist your cache data. This
includes AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, Azure Blob Storage and Rackspace
Cloud Files.
In a perfect world this would have been 8.0.0.Final, but Sod's law
rules, so I give you 8.0.1.Final instead :) So head on over to our
http://infinispan.org/cache-store-implementations/[store download page]
and try it out.

The actual configuration of the cachestore depends on the provider, so
refer to the JClouds documentation. The following is a programmatic
example using the "transient" provider:

And this is how you'd configure it declaratively:


This will work with any Infinispan 8.x release.

Enjoy !
