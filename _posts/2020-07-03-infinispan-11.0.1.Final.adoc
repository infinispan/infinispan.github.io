= Infinispan 11.0.1.Final "Corona Extra"

Dear Infinispan community,

we hope you've been enjoying all the new goodies included in our latest major release, Infinispan 11.
To show that we care about you, we have a brand new micro release for you which addresses a number of issues.

In particular, if you are using HTTP/2 with TLS/SSL, JCache with persistence, Spring Boot or RocksDB, we have fixes for you.

Additionally, the Infinispan Archetypes have been resurrected and are now being maintained as part of the main repository to ensure they won't fall out of sync anymore. Read more about how to link:/docs/stable/titles/getting_started/getting_started.html#mvn_archetypes[get started with a Maven archetype].
