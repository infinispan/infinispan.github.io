Infinispan 9.2.0.Final "Gaina" is out !


Our three-month time-boxing for a minor release plan got a little bit
skewed this time in order to accommodate for some additional overhauls.
This also means that, for a minor release, this is much meatier than
usual.


== Core improvements

* *Conflict resolution*
Automatic conflict resolution after a partition merge is now supported
for all partition handling strategies and is enabled by default.
Furthermore, it is now possible to deploy custom EntryMergePolicy
implementations to the server
* *Reactive streams-based distributed Iteration improvements*
Distributed iterator now uses less threads and allows for efficient
parallel retrieval providing for improved throughput
* *Biased reads for scattered caches*
Originator can read the ‘backup’ copy locally until the data gets
overwritten again. Together with improved read performance this migrates
data to nodes that use it. 
* *Off-heap sizing*
Off-heap requires less overhead per entry and provides for more accurate
sizing allowing you to maximize your memory used
* **Exception based eviction**A new "eviction" that instead of removing
old entries prevents new entries being inserted (supported by all memory
storage and eviction types)

== API improvements

* *Multimap caches*
Available for both Embedded and for Hot Rod, these maps which can store
multiple values for the same key
* *Clustered Counters*
Clustered counters are now available for Hot Rod and in non-clustered
deployments.
* *Clustered Locks*
Available in embedded mode. They allow concurrent synchronization
between nodes in the same cluster
* *Wildcard configurations*
Implicitly use a predefined configuration for all caches whose name
matches a wildcard. This is particularly useful when using Infinispan
through an API which doesn't allow for additional configuration
properties (such as JCache).
* *Cluster-wide cache admin with optional persistence*
The CacheManager API has been enhanced with methods to create/destroy
caches across a cluster, in both Embedded and Hot Rod scenarios (REST
will come in 9.3). Optionally, configurations can be made persistent
across restarts.
* *Cache Stream*
Overloaded collect() method to take Supplier so that collect() in
clustered environments is more user-friendly.

== Data Interoperability


Transcoding is a powerful new feature which allows for transparent
conversion between a number of formats across different endpoints. For
example, it is now possible to write ProtoBuf-encoded data through the
Hot Rod endpoint and retrieve that same data as a JSON document through
the REST endpoint and vice versa. Additionally, such data is also
indexable and queryable.

== Indexing and Query

* *POJO queries over Hot Rod*
It is now possible to directly use Hibernate Search-annotated objects
through JBoss Marshalling/Java serialization without the need for
ProtoBuf over Hot Rod.
* *Broadcast queries*
Clustered queries have been unified with non-clustered queries under a
single API, making their use transparent.

==  

== Infinispan Server

* *Rebased on WildFly 11*
The server baseline has been updated to WildFly 11
* *Async Hot Rod server*
The Hot Rod server now uses async ops, sparing CPU cycles from
context-switching and reducing the latency.
* *Queries over REST*
The REST endpoint now supports running Ickle queries. This is fully
integrated with the above-mentioned JSON support, so your results will
be returned to you as JSON documents.
* *Netty Hot Rod Client*
The Hot Rod Java client network layer has been completely rewritten to
use Netty, bringing true asynchronous calls and some performance
benefits.

==  

== Management, monitoring and logging

*     Console support for counters
*     Improved remote protocol access logging
*     Jolokia is now integrated as a part of the server.

==  

== Infinispan on OpenShift


We have been doing a lot of work in making Infinispan a first-class
citizen of OpenShift. Check out the OpenShift templates for more
details.

== Integrations

* *JCache 1.1*
This release is now aligned with JCache 1.1.
* *Hibernate second-level cache provider*
Traditionally shipped by our friends on the Hibernate ORM team, this
component has now changed ownership over to us. This release includes a
provider for both Hibernate 5.1 and 5.2.
* **Azure cloud discovery**Courtesy of JGroups' extras, we now support
discovery in Azure.

== The codename


In the grand-old tradition of giving major and minor Infinispan releases
a beer-themed codename, 9.2 is no exception.

"_Gaina_", which means "chicken" in the milanese dialect, also happens
to be one of the great beers of the Birrificio Lambrate in Milan.

==  

== Onwards to 9.3


We have already started working on our next release, 9.3 which should be
with you at the end of May. This will continue the work to make
Infinispan fully asynchronous inside out, reducing resource usage and
increasing performance. We are also working on a new modular API which
will improve usability, increase interoperability between embedded and
remote scenarios and take advantage of reactive designs. Transactions
should finally make their appearance in Hot Rod and security will be
greatly enhanced, by taking advantages of the great work done by our
friends over on the Elytron team. We have much more planned, so please
consult our roadmap for details.

== Download, learn and play


You will find downloads, documentation, tutorials, quickstarts and demos
over on our website.

Please let us know on our forum, on IRC, on our issue tracker if you
have any issues with this release, if there is any feature you would
like to see in the future, or just to chat.
