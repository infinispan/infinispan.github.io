Thanks to everyone that downloaded Infinispan 5.0.0.FINAL in the last
month. We've had tremendous feedback and as a result of that we've just
released Infinispan 5.0.1.FINAL to address some of the most important
issues reported. These issues are primarily around
https://docs.jboss.org/author/x/-4B7[distribution clustering mode] and
rehashing. So, if you're using any of these features, I'd strongly
recommend that you upgrade as soon as possible.

Please keep the
http://community.jboss.org/en/infinispan?view=discussions[feedback]
coming, and as always, you can download the release from
http://www.jboss.org/infinispan/downloads[here]Â and you get further
details on the issues addressed in the
https://issues.jboss.org/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?projectId=12310799&version=12318077[changelog].

Finally, we know have a
https://docs.jboss.org/author/x/iYB7[documentation space fully dedicated
to Infinispan 5.0]. Make sure you check it out!

Cheers,
Galder
