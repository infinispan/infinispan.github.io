Good news everyone - Infinispan 5.3.0 will be introducing a
https://issues.jboss.org/browse/ISPN-31[long awaited] JPA cache store.
 This cache store will allow you to store cache entries in the database
using proper schema - so that other applications can read the persisted
data as well.

In normal use cases, it's recommended to leverage Infinispan as JPA
second level cache and/or query cache. However, if you'd like to use
only Infinispan API and you want Infinispan to read from database, or to
persist the data into a database with well defined schema, then JPA
cache store could be right for you.

Prior to JPA cache store, those who wants to use Infinispan in front of
a database to read/write database records would need to write their own
cache store implementation.  Now, with JPA cache store, users can use
Infinispan in front of a database (write-through or write-behind) with
ease by using standard JPA mapping and configurations.

To use the cache store is simple - create the standard JPA configuration
(persistence.xml) and entity class, and then configure the cache
store:


Please see documentations for
detailed https://docs.jboss.org/author/display/ISPN/Cache+Loaders+and+Stores[sample
usage and configuration].

Hope you enjoy this new addition!
