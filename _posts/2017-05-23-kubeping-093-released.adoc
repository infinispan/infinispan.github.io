I'm happy to announce that JGroups KUBE_PING 0.9.3 was released. The
major changes include:

* Fixed releasing connections for embedded HTTP Server
* Fixed JGroups 3/4 compatibility issues
* Fixed test suite
* Fixed `Message.setSrc` compatibility issues
* Updated documentation

The bits might be downloaded from
https://repository.jboss.org/nexus/content/repositories/public-jboss/org/jgroups/kubernetes/kubernetes/0.9.3/[JBoss
Repository] as soon as the sync completes. Please download them from
https://origin-repository.jboss.org/nexus/content/repositories/public-jboss/org/jgroups/kubernetes/kubernetes/0.9.3/[here]
in the meantime.Â 



I would also like to recommend you
http://belaban.blogspot.com/2017/05/running-infinispan-cluster-with.html[recent
blog post created by Bela Ban]. KUBE_PING was completely revamped (no
embedded HTTP Server, reduced dependencies) and we plan to use new,
1.0.0 version in Infinispan soon! If you'd like to try it out, grab it
from
https://repository.jboss.org/nexus/content/repositories/public-jboss/org/jgroups/kubernetes/kubernetes/1.0.0-SNAPSHOT/[here].
