Infinispan 5.1.4.FINAL is out now fixing a bunch of issues as well as
enhancing performance of Infinispan's Memcached and REST servers, plus
it now exposes a couple of
http://docs.jboss.org/infinispan/5.1/apidocs/jmxComponents.html[new JMX
attributes such as cache view (RpcManager.CommittedViewAsString
& RpcManager.PendingViewAsString) and cluster name].

Please note that we've changed the
https://github.com/infinispan/infinispan/blob/5.1.4.FINAL/server/core/src/main/scala/org/infinispan/server/core/Main.scala#L64[default
value of worker threads] for Infinispan servers to be twice the number
of processors instead of 20 times the number of processors in order to
be more efficient out of the box. The number of worker threads is of
course configurable, so you can always modify it according to your use
case.

Full details of what has been fixed can be found
http://goo.gl/JICtJ[here], and if you have feedback, please visit our
http://community.jboss.org/en/infinispan?view=discussions[forums].
Finally, as always, you can download the release from

Cheers,
Galder
