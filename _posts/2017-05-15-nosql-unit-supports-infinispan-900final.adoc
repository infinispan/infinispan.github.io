https://github.com/lordofthejars/nosql-unit[NoSQL Unit] is a JUnit
extension that helps you write NoSQL unit tests, created by
https://github.com/lordofthejars[Alex Soto]. It brings the ideas first
introduced by DBUnit to the world of NoSQL databases.



The essence of DBUnit or NoSQL Unit is that before running each test,
the persistence layer is found in a known state. This makes your test
repeatable, independent of other test failures or potential database
corruptions.



You can use NoSQL Unit for testing embedded or remote Infinispan
instances, and since version 1.0.0-rc.5, which was released a
https://twitter.com/alexsotob/status/859814663885910016[few days back],
it supports the latest Infinispan 9.0.0.Final.

We have a created a
https://github.com/infinispan-demos/infinispan-nosqlunit-demo[little
demo GitHub repository] showing you how to test Infinispan using NoSQL
Unit. Go and give it a go! :)



Thanks Alex bringing NoSQL Unit to my attention!



Cheers,
