had to happen someday - Infinispan's primary source code repository has
now moved to https://github.com/[GitHub].  We have abandoned
http://subversion.tigris.org/[Subversion] as a version control tool for
the far superior
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_revision_control[distributed
VCS] which has found favour in many large and complex open source
projects.  I've been experimenting with a GitHub setup for the past few
weeks, with a snapshot of the Infinispan repository,
and http://git-scm.com/[git] is a sheer joy to use - a sublime
experience, once you get your head around the concepts of distributed
version control.  GitHub makes things even sweeter, with an awesome web
based UI.

Anyway, a quick summary:

Infinispan sources are no longer in Subversion, on JBoss.org

* The http://anonsvn.jboss.org/repos/infinispan/[Infinispan Subversion
repository] is still browseable, in _*read-only mode!*_

The primary repository for Infinispan is now
http://github.com/infinispan/infinispan

* Clone this repository at will!
* Contributions should take the form of pull requests on GitHub

Infinispan's Hudson, release tooling and other systems have been updated
to reflect this change

For those used to working with Infinispan's Subversion-based setup, or
those new to git, I've put together a
http://community.jboss.org/wiki/InfinispanFromSvnToGit[short wiki page]
on getting started with Infinispan on GitHub.

and I'd love to hear your feedback on this move.



Happy cloning!
