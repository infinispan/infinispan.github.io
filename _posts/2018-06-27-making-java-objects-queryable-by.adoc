The following is a common question amongst Infinispan community users:

_____________________________________________________________
*How do I make my Java objects queryable by remote clients?* 
_____________________________________________________________



=== Annotation Method


The simplest way is to take advantage
https://github.com/infinispan/protostream[Infinispan Protostream]
annotations to mark your objects queryable and decide how each object
field should be indexed. Example:


Then, the
https://github.com/infinispan/protostream/blob/master/core/src/main/java/org/infinispan/protostream/annotations/ProtoSchemaBuilder.java[ProtoSchemaBuilder]
can inspect the annotated class and derive a
https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/[Google Protocol Buffers]
schema file from it. Example:


Finally, the schema file needs to be registered in the
“___protobuf_metadata” cache:


Although this is by far the easiest way to make your Java objects
queryable, this method might not always be viable. For example, you
might not be able to modify the Java object classes to add the
annotations. For such use cases, a more verbose method is available that
does not require modifying the source code of the Java object.


=== Plain Object Method


For example, given this Java object:


A Protocol Buffers schema must be defined where comments are used to
define the object as queryable and decide how each field is indexed:


This method also requires a
https://github.com/infinispan/protostream/blob/master/core/src/main/java/org/infinispan/protostream/MessageMarshaller.java[Protostream
message marshaller] to be defined which specifies how each field is
serialized/deserialized:


This method still requires the Protocol Buffers schema to be registered
remotely, but on top of that, the schema and marshaller need to be
registered in the client:


Clearly, this second method is a lot more verbose and more laborious
when refactoring. If any changes are made to the Java object, the
marshaller and Protocol Buffer schema need to also be changed
accordingly. This is done automatically in the first method.

Both methods are demonstrated in full in the
https://github.com/infinispan-demos/queryable-pojos[queryable-pojos
demo].
