The first beta version of the Infinispan native python client to connect
to the Infinispan Hot Rod servers is available now from
https://github.com/infinispan/python-client/archives/1.0.0b1[Infinispan's
GitHub] repository or http://pypi.python.org/pypi/infinispan[PyPi].
Please check the
https://github.com/infinispan/python-client/blob/master/README.md[latest
README information] to find out more about installation instructions.

So, what's in it? For this first beta release, we've implemented all the
operations available in the
http://community.jboss.org/docs/DOC-14421[Hot Rod specification] and
they've been tested with string inputs. This release does not include
code to deal with client intelligence superior to 1, so clients cannot
receive notifications of cluster changes nor can they locate data in an
intelligent manner by applying consistent hash algorithms to the keys.
These capabilities, plus further examples such as how to integrate with
payloads from Google Protocol Buffers will come in next beta releases.

If you're looking for code examples for the Infinispan Python client,
you can find a very basic one in
https://github.com/infinispan/python-client/blob/master/README.md[the
README file itself], or check the testsuite within the source package.
In next releases we'll be creating a wiki with more detailed examples.

As always, if you have any doubt please use the
http://community.jboss.org/en/infinispan?view=discussions[user forums]
and for any bugs or feature requests, please log them via
https://issues.jboss.org/browse/ISPN[JIRA].

Cheers,
Galder
