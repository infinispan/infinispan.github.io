Dear Infinispan Community,

we're glad to announce that 9.3.0.CR1 is out!

This is the first release which works with both Java 8 and Java 10.
Pre-releases of Java 11 work too. Note that Infinispan still only works
in classpath mode.

Highlights of this release include:

[#docs-internal-guid-fcf54778-c9b3-e418-2086-683286f85b79]#Expanded
transaction support in Hot Rod, which can now participate in Java
transactions via Sync or Xa enlistment. Transaction recovery isn't
supported yet.#

Caches can now configure the maximum number of attempts to start a
CacheWriter/CacheLoader on startup before cache creation fails.

Write-behind stores are now fault-tolerant by default

Segmented On-Heap Data Container improves stream operation performance

We have introduced several WildFly feature packs to make it easier for
Infinispan to be utilised on WildFly instances via the
https://github.com/wildfly/wildfly-build-tools[Server Provisioning
Plugin]. The following feature packs have been created:

* infinispan-feature-pack-client: all of the modules required to connect
to a hotrod server via the client
* infinispan-feature-pack-embedded: the modules required for embedded
instances of Infinispan
* infinispan-feature-pack-embedded-query: the same as above but with
query capabilities
* infinispan-feature-pack-wf-modules: this is equivalent to the
wildfly-modules.zip

2-Level cache now works with Hibernate ORM 5.3

The server now allows multiple protocols with a Single Port. The initial
version supports HTTP/1.1, HTTP/2 and Hot Rod. Switching protocols can
be done using TLS/ALPN and HTTP/1.1 Upgrade header.

Admin console - improved all editors (schema, scripts, JSON data) to
include syntax highlighting

Component Upgrades: Hibernate Search 5.10 and Hibernate ORM 5.3

Numerous bug fixes which improve stability are also included
(https://issues.jboss.org/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?projectId=12310799&version=12337256[here]
is the full list of the solved issues).

As usual, you can find all the bits on
our http://infinispan.org/download/[website]. If you find any issues,
don't hesitate to report them on
our https://issues.jboss.org/projects/ISPN[issue tracker.]
