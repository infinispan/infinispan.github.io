I'm very proud to announce yet another beta release in the 5.1
'_Brahma_' series. This time is the turn of Infinispan 5.1.0.BETA3 which
apart from containing
https://issues.jboss.org/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?projectId=12310799&version=12318377[many
small fixes], it comes with two major improvements:

#*Fine-grained Atomic Maps*#

http://docs.jboss.org/infinispan/5.1/apidocs/org/infinispan/atomic/AtomicMap.html[Atomic
Maps] are special constructs that users can use to bundle data into the
value side of a key/value pair. What's special about them is that when
the map changes, only the changes or deltas of that map are transfered,
which makes Atomic Maps very efficient from a replication perspective
when individual elements are modified.

Up until Infinispan 5.1.0.BETA2, the other interesting characteristic of
these Atomic Maps was the fact that Atomic Map locking and isolation
happened at the the level of the entire Atomic Map. So, if a single
key/value pair in the Atomic Map was modified, the entire map was
locked.

Starting with Infinispan 5.1.0.BETA3, thanks to Vladimir Blagojevic,
Atomic Maps supporting fine-grained locking are available
http://docs.jboss.org/infinispan/5.1/apidocs/org/infinispan/atomic/AtomicMapLookup.html#getFineGrainedAtomicMap(org.infinispan.Cache,%20MK)[as
well]. What this means is that an Atomic Map's key/value pairs can be
modified in parallel thanks to the ability to lock individual map
entries as opposed to the entire map.

This will be particularly handy for heavy Atomic Map users such as
http://www.jboss.org/as7[JBoss Application Server 7] which uses Atomic
Maps for maintaining HTTP sessions, and
http://www.hibernate.org/subprojects/ogm.html[Hibernate OGM] which
decomposes entities into Atomic Maps.

#*Hot Rod server topology improvements*#

When we originally designed https://docs.jboss.org/author/x/OoJa[Hot Rod
protocol version 1.0], we decided that whenever a distributed cache
wanted to send information about the topology of the backend servers to
the clients, we'd send the hash ids of each of these nodes. At the time,
this seemed like a good idea, until virtual nodes were implemented...

With virtual nodes, each physical Hot Rod server can potentially
represent tens, hundreds or even thousands of different virtual nodes.
If we stuck with the original protocol, that would mean that we'd have
to send each virtual node's hash id back to the client. So, for a
cluster of 8 nodes, and 1000 virtual nodes, that'd be at least 80kb of
hash ids being transfered back to the client, on top of tons of
redundant information about a node's host and port, which is very
inefficient.

So, after having some discussions, we decided to evolve the
https://docs.jboss.org/author/x/eICQ[Hot Rod protocol to version 1.1] in
order to address this issue. The end result is that now it's the
responsibility of the Hot Rod client to generate the hash ids of each of
the physical nodes. We do that by sticking to a general formula to
generate a Hot Rod server's hash id which both the Hot Rod server and
clients can implement.

This improvement has also lead to the significant decrease in memory
consumption of the Hot Rod server because it does not need to cache
those hash ids anymore.

So, if you are using Infinispan Hot Rod servers and in particular
you'are configuring virtual nodes, you definitely should be upgrading
your Hot Rod server and client libraries. From a client code
perspective, no changes are necessary because starting with 5.1.0.BETA3,
Hot Rod clients talk to servers using this latest protocol.

Finally, remember to use
