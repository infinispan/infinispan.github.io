This week, the 25th of January, I will be presenting a talk
about  https://infinispan.org/docs/dev/user_guide/user_guide.html#clustered_lock[Clustered
Locks] at the http://snowcamp.io/en/[Snowcamp 2018 conference] in
Grenoble (France). During the live-coding talk, I will share the design
and code I've been working on to create this first version of the
clustered locks. These locks will be used by the
http://vertx.io/docs/vertx-infinispan/java/[Vert.x Cluster Manager], but
they can be useful to any Infinispan user since version 9.2 (final
release coming very soon!!). If you are planning to use this API, we
would love to hear from you to give us some feedback and keep us posted
on your use case!

If you are attending the conference, fell free to reach me to discuss
about Infinispan+Vert.x, locks,
 https://infinispan.org/docs/dev/user_guide/user_guide.html#multimap_cache[Multimap],
https://infinispan.org/blog/2017/12/first-steps-with-vertx-and-infinispan-rest-api.html[cute
names] or any other topic that you care about!

See you!

Katia
