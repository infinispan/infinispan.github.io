5.2.0.Beta6 brings a new batch of fixes around Non-Blocking State
Transfer, Map/Reduce and command line interface.
But it's not only that, it also brings a bran new pice of functionality:
support of concurrent updates for non-transactional
caches(https://issues.jboss.org/browse/ISPN-2552[ISPN-2552]) . Prior
Infinispan 5.2.0.Beta6, there was a high chance for a deadlock to occur
when two threads concurrently update the same key. This caused
significant performance costs and throughput degradation, linear to the
amount of contention. This functionality is enabled by default even
though a compatibility mode is still available. You can read more about
it
https://docs.jboss.org/author/display/ISPN/Locking+and+Concurrency#LockingandConcurrency-Nontransactionalcachesandconcurrentupdates%26nbsp%3B[here].


For a detailed list of all the issues fixed please refer
