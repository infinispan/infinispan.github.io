Since version 5.0 (Pagoa) Infinispan has a new module. This module is a
portable http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=299[CDI] extension which
integrates Infinispan with the CDI programming model. Here are some
highlights of what is provided:

* full integration with *Java EE 6*
* **typesafe **cache (and cache manager) injection
* **JCACHE **annotations support

Please note that this module is a technology preview and its API can
still change. Next let's discuss some of its details.



#Typesafe injection and configuration of cache#



The first feature you can use out of the box is the *typesafe* injection
of the _Cache_ and the _CacheManager_. Without any configuration you can
inject the default cache, as well as the cache manager used by the
extension. This injection can be performed in any bean managed by Java
EE like EJB, Servlet and CDI beans. The only thing to do is to use
the _@Inject_ annotation:







Please note that the cache injection is typed. In this case, only
_String_ typed Java objects could be added as key and value.

It's also possible to configure the injected cache using CDI. The first
step is to create a CDI qualifier, and then create the cache
configuration producer, annotated with _@ConfigureCache_. The qualifier
is used to qualify the injection point and the cache configuration
producer:




In the same way, a cache can be defined with the default configuration
of the cache manager in use, using a producer field:




One advantage of this approach is that all cache configurations of the
entire application can be gathered together into a single
_Configuration_ class.

The Infinispan CDI extension provides a cache manager with a default
configuration (and it is used by default). You can also override the
default configuration (used by the default cache manager), as well as
the default cache manager. You can find more information
https://docs.jboss.org/author/x/BAFZ[here].

#JCache annotations support#

JCache (aka http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=107[JSR-107]) is famous as
the oldest open JSR. However, this JSR has recently seen extensive
progress, and is a candidate for inclusion in Java EE 7
(http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=342[JSR-342]).

This specification defines a standard caching API to work with a
standalone cache, as well as a distributed cache. An interesting part of
the specification are the annotations which are designed to solve common
caching use cases. Some of the annotations defined by this specification
are:

* _@CacheResult_ caches the result of a method call
* _@CachePut_ caches a method parameter
* _@CacheRemoveEntry_ removes an entry from a cache
* _@CacheRemoveAll_ removes all entries from a cache

The following example illustrates the use of these annotations:





The Infinispan CDI extension adds support for these annotations. The
only thing to do is to enable the CDI interceptors in your application
_beans.xml_ - you can find more information
https://docs.jboss.org/author/x/BAFZ[here].

#Infinispan CDI and JBoss AS 7#

With JBoss AS 7, you can setup an Infinispan cache manager in the server
configuration file. This allows you to externalize your Infinispan
configuration and also to lookup the cache manager from JNDI, normally
with the _@Resource_ annotation. This
http://infinispan.blogspot.com/2011/07/infinispan-in-jboss-as7.html[post]
has more details on the subject.

As we mentioned earlier, you can override the default cache manager used
by the Infinispan CDI extension. To use a JBoss AS 7 configured cache,
you need to use the cache manager defined in JBoss AS 7. You only need
to annotate the default cache manager producer with _@Resource_.
Simple!




Now, you can inject the cache defined in JBoss AS 7 as we described
earlier.

#What's next?#

Here is a highlight of the features you will see soon.

* support for all JSR 107 annotations - _@CachePut_, _@CacheDefaults_
* support for remote cache
* ability to listen Infinispan events with CDI observers
* and more - let us know what you want ;-)

As usual you can open issues and features request on the Infinispan
https://issues.jboss.org/browse/ISPN[JIRA] (component _CDI
Integration_).

Feel free to open a topic in the Infinispan
http://community.jboss.org/en/infinispan?view=discussions[forum] if you
need help.

To see the Infinispan CDI extension in action you can browse and run the
quickstart application

Enjoy!
