Dear Infinispan community,

I'm pleased to announce that the C++/C# clients version 8.1.0.Alpha2 are
out!

Some of the good news coming with this release:

* more bugs fixed than added
* SNI support
* C++ Client listener for remote events


Download it from the usual link http://infinispan.org/hotrod-clients/


We're trying to keep track of the 8.1 trip at this Jira url:
https://issues.jboss.org/browse/HRCPP-289[Features list for 8.1]
Feedbacks, proposals, hints are welcome!

Cheers,
The Infinispan Team
