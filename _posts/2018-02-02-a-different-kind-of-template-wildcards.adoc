Infinispan's configuration templates are an extremely flexible way to
create multiple caches using the same configuration. Configuration
inheritance works by explicitly declaring the configuration a specific
cache should use.

This works fine when you know the caches you are going to use upfront,
but in more dynamic scenarios, this might not be possible. Additionally,
if you are using the JCache API, there is no way for you to specify the
configuration template you want to use.

Infinispan 9.2 introduces an alternative way to apply templates to
caches: wildcards. By creating a template with a wildcard in its name,
e.g. `basecache*`, any cache whose name matches the template name will
inherit that configuration.

Let's show an example:


Above, caches `basecache-1` and `basecache-2` will use the `basecache*`
configuration. This behaviour also applies when retrieving caches
programmatically:



When using the JCache API, using the XML file above and the following
code will achieve the same result:



NOTE: If a cache name matches multiple wildcards, i.e. it is ambiguous,
an exception will be thrown.

I will be introducing other new features that Infinispan 9.2 brings to
cache configuration in an upcoming blog post. Stay tuned !
