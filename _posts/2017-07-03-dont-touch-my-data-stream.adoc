In Infinispan 8.0 we were very excited to announce
http://blog.infinispan.org/2015/09/distributed-streams.html[Distributed
Streams] as we moved to Java 8. This feature allows applying any of the
various java.util.stream.Stream operations on the datagrid, which are
performed in a distributed nature, providing the highest possible
performance as data is processed on the node where it lives, only
requiring the terminal operation intermediate results to be returned to
the invoker.

One problem with distributed streams though is that data is processed
without acquiring locks: great for performance, but there is no
guarantee that some other process isn't concurrently modifying the cache
entry you're working on. Consider the following example which iterates
through the entire contents of a cache, modifying each entry based on
its existing value:


This works great until you have another cache _put()_ running
concurrently that changes a value. In this case the only way to be sure
that an update is applied properly is to perform an optional update in
the _forEach._ In a transactional cache you could also lock the entry
manually (pessimistic) or retry on a _WriteSkewException_ (optimistic).
For example this is how the optional update could be performed.


As you can see the code isn't as pretty as it was before, but is still
pretty concise.

Infinispan 9.1 introduces _locked streams_, which allow you to run your
operation knowing that another update cannot be performed while running
the _Consumer_. Note this only works in non transactional and
pessimistic transactional caches (optimistic transactional caches are
not supported).


If you notice the code looks very similar to the first example. You just
have to invoke the _lockedStream_ method on the _AdvancedCache_ and then
you can use the stream knowing that data for the given key won't change
while performing your update.

This locked stream has a slightly limited API compared to the normal
java.util.stream API. Only the _filter_ method is allowed in addition to
_forEach._ The _CacheStream_ API is also supported, with a few
exceptions. For more details on the API and what methods are supported
you should check out the
https://docs.jboss.org/infinispan/9.1/apidocs/org/infinispan/LockedStream.html[Javadoc].

The lock is only acquired for the given key while invoking the
_Consumer_, allowing other updates on other keys to be performed
concurrently, just like a normal _put_ operation would behave. It is not
suggested to perform operations on other keys in the _Consumer,_ as this
could cause possible deadlocks.

Now go forth and perform operations using the data stream knowing that
the data underneath has not changed!
