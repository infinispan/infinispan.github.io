We've had two very hectic weeks delivering the
http://infinispan.org/[Infinispan]/http://vertx.io/[Vert.x]/https://www.openshift.com/[OpenShift]
Streaming Data workshop in http://www.duchess-france.org/[Duchess
France] and https://devoxx.be/[Devoxx Belgium]. First of all, thanks to
all attendees for taking the time to attend this workshop and working
through it, thanks Duchess and Devoxx for letting us present the
workshop, and thanks the sponsors for making it happen!

In case you want to walk through the workshop at your own pace, the
version of the workshop delivered at Duchess and Devoxx can be found
https://github.com/infinispan-demos/streaming-data-workshop/tree/devoxx-belgium-17[here].
The slides from the workshop can be found
https://speakerdeck.com/galderz/streaming-data-workhop-at-devoxx[here].

The aim of the workshop was to show how to work with multiple data
streams and combine them in interested ways. These two streams of data
came from http://transport.opendata.ch/[Transport API at OpenData.ch]
and https://www.sbb.ch/[SBB.ch] respectively. The end-game of the
workshop was to see to combine both sets of information to produce a map
that tracked positions of delayed trains around Switzerland.

On 2nd November we did a dry run of the workshop in the Duchess France
group. This was a very compact group of people, around 10-12, which gave
us thve first taste of what it was like to work through it. In
particular, we realised that getting Virtual Box to run on each
attendees laptop took some time to get working. From the workshop
perspective, we found that the exercises themselves were a bit too long
for the people to complete.

With all the invaluable input, Katia, Thomas and myself got ready for
delivering the workshop at Devoxx Belgium, one of the top developer
conferences in Europe. The pressure was on! We had ~60 attendees, so we
had to make sure everyone could progress.

At Devoxx, we were more prepared to help out with set up problems, so
everyone got to the starting point much faster. After working through
the initial exercise to get used to Infinispan, Vert.x and OpenShift,
attendees got on with the workshop itself.

During the workshop exercises, the learnt about Infinispan's in-memory
data grid capabilities, and in particular about continuous query which
is very well suited for feeding data to live updating maps or
dashboards. They also learnt about how easy it is to build reactive
applications with http://vertx.io/docs/vertx-rx/java/[Vert.x and
RxJava]. Finally, they learnt how to deploy applications to OpenShift,
how to monitor their progress...etc.

A majority of Devoxx attendees managed to get to the end of the workshop
which was a success for us, but we listen to their feedback and we will
continue to improve the content and delivery as we prepare for
https://2017.codemotion.es/[Codemotion Madrid] where we are delivering
the workshop once again.

Thanks attendees, Devoxx, Duchess and sponsors!!

Cheers,
Galder
