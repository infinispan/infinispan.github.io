Exactly one week ago I was presenting a talk on big data in action with
Infinispan and two days later the video has already been uploaded!!
Fastest ever conference video release I've seen! Kudos to
https://berlinbuzzwords.de/[Berlin Buzzwords] 👏

The https://speakerdeck.com/galderz/big-data-in-action-1[slides] for the
talk can be found here, and the video is here:



Berlin Buzzwords was a very interesting conference. Similar to
https://jonthebeach.com/[J On The Beach], it's a conference focused on
data related technologies, but Berlin Buzzwords had a more Apache focus.
So, you had many talks on Solr, Lucene, Spark, Flink, Kafka, Beam...etc,
as well as Apache spinoffs such as ElasticSearch.

The conference was very well organised and the talks were good, although
I did miss some demos in the talks I attended. Having been presenting
Infinispan for over 8 years, I am fully aware that coming up with data
related demos is not an easy task. However, with some many open data
streams available these days, there has never been a bigger opportunity
to put some of that data to work in a live demo and demonstrate why your
tech is so awesome.

From an Infinispan perspective, it was fascinating talking to Flink,
Beam...etc developers and learn how Infinispan could be integrated with
these projects. We already have Hadoop and Spark integrations, but we're
not standing still and we will continue to integrate with other popular
data processing technologies.

On a personal level, it was awesome to meet
https://spark-summit.org/2016/speakers/william-benton/[William Benton]
once again and we had some very interesting discussions about
https://radanalytics.io/[Radanalytics], a project that helps you build
data-driven applications on top of OpenShift. I also had some
interesting chats with fellow Basel residents working for Baloise
insurance group and the University of Basel.

Cheers,
Galder
