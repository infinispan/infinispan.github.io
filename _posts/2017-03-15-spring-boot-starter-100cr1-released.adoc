I'm happy to announce a new release (the first feature-complete!) of
Infinispan Spring Boot Starters.

We finally added new properties for managing Hot Rod client mode in
_application.properties_ as well Spring Cache automatic support.
Finally, we fixed a couple of smaller issues.

For complete changelog, please refer to the
https://github.com/infinispan/infinispan-spring-boot/releases[release
page].

The artifacts should be available in Maven Central as soon as the sync
completes. In the meantime grab them
from https://origin-repository.jboss.org/nexus/content/repositories/public-jboss/org/infinispan/infinispan-spring-boot-starter/1.0.0.CR1/[JBoss
Repository].
