Corporate slaves often spend months of paper work only to find their
machine obsolete before its powered on.   Forward thinking individuals
need playgrounds to try out new ideas.  Enterprise 2.0 projects have to
scale with their user base.  In short, there's a lot of demand for
flexible infrastructure.
 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_infrastructure#Infrastructure[Cloud
infrastructure] is one way to fill that order.



One popular cloud infrastructure provider is
http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/[Amazon EC2].  EC2 is basically a
pay-as-you-go datacenter.  You pay for CPU, storage, and network
resources.  Using the open-source
http://www.jboss.org/infinispan[Infinispan] data grid, you have a good
chance of linear performance as your application needs change.  Using
EC2, you can instantly bring on hosts to support that need.  Great
match, right?  What's next?



Assuming your data is important, you will need to persist your
Infinispan cluster somewhere.   That said, Amazon charges you for
traffic that goes in and out of their network... this could get
expensive.  So, the next bit is controlling these costs. 



Amazon offers a storage service called http://aws.amazon.com/s3/[S3].
 Transferring data between EC2 and S3 is free; you only pay for data
parking.  In short, there is a way to control these I/O costs: S3. 



Infinispan will save your cluster to S3 when configured with its
high-performance http://code.google.com/p/jclouds/[JClouds] plug-in.
 You specify the S3 Bucket and your AWS credentials and Infinispan does
the rest.



In summary, not only does Infinispan shred your license costs, but we
also help cut your persistence costs, too!



So, go ahead: Keep it in the cloud!
