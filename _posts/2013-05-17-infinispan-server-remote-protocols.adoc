A couple of weeks ago, Infinispan 5.3.0.Beta1 was released, which
brought a slew of improvements to two of the remoting protocols: Hot Rod
and REST. This week's 5.3.0.Beta2 brings even more goodies: the ability
to expose the same container over multiple Hot Rod endpoints and the
integration of the WebSocket endpoint. We've also been working on
fleshing out the
https://docs.jboss.org/author/display/ISPN/Infinispan+Server[documentation]
for the server.


== Hot Rod SSL


Hot Rod, Infinispan's own high-performance, topology aware protocol, has
gained the ability to encrypt the communication using SSL and optionally
require client certificate authentication. While this is still not the
full-blown authentication/authorization infrastructure we will be
implementing for Infinispan 6.0, it is the first step in that
direction.
In the context of the Infinispan Server, setting this up is quite
simple. Download the Infinispan Server distribution from
http://www.jboss.org/infinispan/downloads and unzip it.
Next create a keystore with a self-signed certificate:

$ keytool -genkey -alias hotrod -keyalg RSA -keystore keystore.jks
-keysize 2048
Enter keystore password:  secret
Re-enter new password: secret
What is your first and last name?
  [Unknown]:  HotRod
What is the name of your organizational unit?
  [Unknown]:  Infinispan
What is the name of your organization?
  [Unknown]:  JBoss
What is the name of your City or Locality?
  [Unknown]:  Red Hat
What is the name of your State or Province?
  [Unknown]:  World
What is the two-letter country code for this unit?
  [Unknown]:  WW
Is CN=HotRod, OU=Infinispan, O=JBoss, L=Red Hat, ST=World, C=WW
correct?
  [no]:  yes

Enter key password for <hotrod>
    (RETURN if same as keystore password):

Put the keystore in the standalone/configuration directory together with
the standalone-hotrod-ssl.xml from the docs/examples/configs
directory.
Now start the server using bin/standalone.sh -c
standalone-hotrod-ssl.xml
This will start a server with a HotRod endpoint on port 11222 which will
only accept SSL connections.

Now we need a client:


This client needs to find the keystore.jks file you generated above.


== Hot Rod container sharing


Another feature added to the Hot Rod endpoint is the ability to share
the same container between multiple endpoints, and exposing them on
different interfaces. This could be used to offer an unencrypted backend
endpoint to be used by "internal" servers to populate the cache and an
encrypted frontend endpoint to be used by "external" applications. With
the future addition of authorization, this will offer the ability to
handle many types of security scenarios.


== REST Extended Headers


The REST endpoint now returns the Expires header for mortal entries. It
will also return additional headers when the extended query parameter is
added, e.g. GET /cacheName/cacheKey?extended
will return the following custom headers:

* Cluster-Primary-Owner: the node name of the primary owner for this key
* Cluster-Node-Name: the JGroups node name of the server that has
handled the request
* Cluster-Physical-Address: the physical JGroups address of the server
that has handled the request.

With the introduction of custom metadata, courtesy of
https://jira.jboss.org/browse/ISPN-2281[ISPN-2281], we will also allow
returning that information too.


== REST Collections


Another improvement made to the REST endpoint is the ability to retrieve
all keys in a cache, by simply invoking a GET /cacheName
This will return a list of keys present in the given cacheName as the
body of the response. The format of the response can be controlled via
the Accept header as follows:

* application/xml - the list of keys will be returned in XML format.
* application/json - the list of keys will be return in JSON format.
* text/html - the list of keys will be returned in HTML format.
* text/plain - the list of keys will be returned in plain text format,
one key per line

If the cache identified by cacheName is distributed, only the keys owned
by the node handling the request will be returned. To return all keys,
append the "global" parameter to the query, as follows: GET
/cacheName?global


== WebSocket endpoint


The WebSocket endpoint is now finally part of the new Infinispan Server
package. Bear in mind that this is just a pure WebSocket server. When we
will be able to upgrade our base from AS 7.x to WildFly 8 we will be
able to take advantage of the new Undertow web server which has native
support for WebSockets.
