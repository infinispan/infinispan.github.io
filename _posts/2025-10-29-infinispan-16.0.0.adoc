= Infinispan 16.0

*_"Keep Rollin'"_*

Infinispan 16.0 is here, and it is codenamed https://untappd.com/b/lake-of-bays-brewing-company-keep-rollin/5822804["Keep Rollin'"].

This is a very significant release, as it introduces zero-downtime in-place rolling upgrades: the capability of
incrementally upgrading individual nodes in a cluster without having to stop operations.

== In-place rolling upgrades

Starting with Infinispan 16.0, we guarantee that it will be possible to upgrade the nodes of a live Infinispan cluster
to a newer version with zero downtime.
This guarantee will initially cover point releases (16.0.x -> 16.0.y), but we will strive to also maintain it across
minor releases (16.x -> 16.y): for every new release, we will be providing a table of supported upgrade paths to help
you plan your upgrade strategies.

=== Clustering

The clustering messages, that Infinispan nodes use to communicate with each other, have been rewritten to use
https://protobuf.dev/[Protocol Buffers], via the https://github.com/infinispan/protostream[ProtoStream] serialization
library. By adopting ProtoBuf's https://protobuf.dev/best-practices/dos-donts/[best practices] for schema evolution and
a number of supporting tools, we can guarantee that incompatibilities cannot be introduced into these messages without
breaking our builds and tests.

== Upgrade test harness

We have implemented an extensive test harness, integrated into our CI pipelines, that validates that every change that is
made to Infinispan does not break backwards compatibility. This harness exercises every command,
supported by coverage reports that help us identify untested code paths.

== Console

== Server container image

The Infinispan Server container image is now built using the bare minimum required components, aiming to provide a
significantly reduced attack surface.

== JDK improvements
While Infinispan still requires at least JDK 17, we have made several changes to take advantage of the features
introduced in newer JDKs, including support for the recently released JDK 25.

=== Virtual threads

=== AOT

Infinispan Server (and the CLI) can leverage OpenJDK's Ahead-of-Time features introduced in https://openjdk.org/jeps/483[JEP 483] to
decrease startup time and initial memory usage.


== Fixes
Lots of these. However, should you find something that doesn't work, head over to our
https://github.com/infinispan/infinispan/issues[issues] and provide any details that help us debug and solve problems.


== Deprecations and removals

== Documentation

As usual, many improvements, updates and fixes.

== What's next?

Infinispan is adopting timeboxed releases starting with our next release (16.1)

== Release notes
