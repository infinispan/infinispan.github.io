= Infinispan 16.0

*_"Keep Rollin'"_*

Infinispan 16.0 is here, and it is codenamed https://untappd.com/b/lake-of-bays-brewing-company-keep-rollin/5822804["Keep Rollin'"].

This is a very significant release, as it introduces zero-downtime in-place rolling upgrades: the capability of
incrementally upgrading individual nodes in a cluster without having to stop operations.

== In-place rolling upgrades

Starting with Infinispan 16.0, we guarantee that it will be possible to upgrade the nodes of a live Infinispan cluster
to a newer version with zero downtime.
This guarantee will initially cover point releases (16.0.x -> 16.0.y), but we will strive to also maintain it across
minor releases (16.x -> 16.y): for every new release, we will be providing a table of supported upgrade paths to help
you plan your upgrade strategies.

=== Clustering

The clustering messages, that Infinispan nodes use to communicate with each other, have been rewritten to use
https://protobuf.dev/[Protocol Buffers], via the https://github.com/infinispan/protostream[ProtoStream] serialization
library. By adopting ProtoBuf's https://protobuf.dev/best-practices/dos-donts/[best practices] for schema evolution and
a number of supporting tools, we can guarantee that incompatibilities cannot be introduced into these messages without
breaking our builds and tests.

== Upgrade test harness

We have implemented an extensive test harness, integrated into our CI pipelines, that validates that every change that is
made to Infinispan does not break backwards compatibility. This harness exercises every command,
supported by coverage reports that help us identify untested code paths.

== Console

== Server

We have introduced several fixes and enhancements to the Infinispan Server.

=== Server container image

The Infinispan Server container image is now built using the bare minimum required components, aiming to provide a
significantly reduced attack surface.

=== Server startup

We have decoupled the server and the cache container start procedure, where they can start concurrently.
This provides a faster startup time for the server, that can start replying to requests earlier.
This helps in scenarios where the server receive probe requests for liveness and readiness. Also this allows
for better handling when a cache may fail to start allowing other caches to continue operating.

=== On-demand caches

The caches associated with dedicated connectors, such as Memcached and RESP, do not create the caches at start.
These caches are now created on demand at the first access.
In case these endpoints are not accessed, the caches are never created.

== JDK improvements
While Infinispan still requires at least JDK 17, we have made several changes to take advantage of the features
introduced in newer JDKs, including support for the recently released JDK 25.

=== Virtual threads

Infinispan by default not utilized Virtual Threads in both Embedded and Server modes. This includes Infinispan
enabling virtual threads in JGroups by default. Virtual threads are used by the non blocking and blocking thread
pools in Embedded mode and the blocking thread pool in Server mode. The latter utilizes Netty event loop for its
non blocking thread pool which does not yet support virtual threads.

If neccesary is possible to disable by setting the `org.infinispan.threads.virtual` system property to `false`.

=== AOT

Infinispan Server (and the CLI) can leverage OpenJDK's Ahead-of-Time features introduced in https://openjdk.org/jeps/483[JEP 483] to
decrease startup time and initial memory usage.


== Fixes
Lots of these. However, should you find something that doesn't work, head over to our
https://github.com/infinispan/infinispan/issues[issues] and provide any details that help us debug and solve problems.


== Deprecations and removals

SingleFileStore has now been completely replaced by the more scalable SoftIndexFileStore and cannot be configured via
xml any longer.

== Documentation

As usual, many improvements, updates and fixes.

== What's next?

Infinispan is adopting timeboxed releases starting with our next release (16.1)
