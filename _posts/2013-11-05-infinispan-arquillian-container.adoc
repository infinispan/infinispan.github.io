Dear Infinispan users,
a new version of Infinispan Arquillian Container has been released into
JBoss Maven Repository as maven artifacts. The previous version was
announced by
http://blog.infinispan.org/2012/09/infinispan-arquillian-container-100cr1.html
The blog post contains information related to setup of JBoss Maven
Repository, including its address as well as address of the Infinispan
Arquillian Container itself.

Maybe we should now call the project Infinispan Arquillian extension
rather than Infinispan Arquillian Container because, since version 5.3,
Infinispan Server has been based on JBoss Application Server 7 and the
submodule called infinispan-arquillian-container could be removed.

As a result, the configuration of Arquillian with respect to Infinispan
Server was simplified.


== Developing tests with Infinispan Server


Now there's only one way to compose the arquillian.xml file:


The property ispnHome no longer exists. The path to the Infinispan
Server is now specified via jbossHome. The serverConfig attribute then
specifies the correct configuration file for the server.

In order to run tests with Infinispan Arquillian extension, one should
use the following dependencies:
org.jboss.as:jboss-as-arquillian-container-managed:jar:7.2.0.Final:test
org.infinispan.arquillian.container:infinispan-arquillian-impl:jar:1.1.0.Alpha1:test

Now that we've configured the server to run in our tests, it's time to
introduce a few enhancements which will help you write tests more
effectively.


=== RemoteInfinispanServers

You can still inject the reference to a running Infinispan Server by
annotating an instance variable of type RemoteInfinispanServer with
@InfinispanResource.


When there are more Infinispan servers to be injected, you can now use
the following snippet instead of injecting each server independently:


Â 
Then you can retrieve individual servers by calling .getServer(name) on
the servers variable. The name must correspond to an existing container
definition within arquillian.xml. The results of this call will be of
type RemoteInfinispanServer.


=== WithRunningServer

So far users were forced to start the Infinispan Server either before
the whole test suite (mode="suite") or before each class separately
(mode="class"). The annotation WithRunningServer enables users to
automatically start the server before a test method and stop it after
the method. Example:


Note that in this case containers should be marked as mode="manual" in
arquillian.xml file so that Infinispan Arquillian extension can handle
lifecycle of these servers by itself.

When @WithRunningServer annotation is placed on a class, the server(s)
will be started before the first method call in the test class, and
stopped when JUnit @AfterClass event is triggered.


=== IPv6 support

Infinispan Arquillian extension can now work with Infinispan Server
running on IPv6 as it can correctly connect to the server via JMX.


== Testing embedded Infinispan


Running tests with plain Infinispan libraries instead of Infinispan
Server has not changed since the last release. Read more about it in the
previous blog post.

Thanks to Michal Linhard and Vitalii Chepeliuk who helped move the
project one step further.

Cheers,
Martin
