Why would you listen to podcasts?

First to learn new things but also to fill gaps where you can't look at
a screen and would be borderline bored: walking the dog, running,
standing up in the subway, dish washing, vacuum cleaning, you name it.
Don't listen to Infinispan podcasts while operating heavy machinery!
