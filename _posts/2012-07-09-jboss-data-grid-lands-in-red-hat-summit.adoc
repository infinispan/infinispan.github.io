It's just over a week since http://www.redhat.com/summit/[Red Hat
Summit/JBoss World 2012] finished and it was a great pleasure to be part
of it. Heiko Rupp and I were speaking about "Effectively Manage &
Monitor Red Hat JBoss Data Grid Nodes" where we presented
http://www.redhat.com/products/jbossenterprisemiddleware/data-grid/[JDG]
and
http://www.redhat.com/products/jbossenterprisemiddleware/operations-network/[JON]
at a high level and then we showed a demo of both products interacting
with each other. The presentation's slides are now

for download].



I was not the only one speaking about JBoss Data Grid. Both Manik, the
Infinispan project lead, and Alan Santos, the product manager for
Infinispan, were also delivering talks on JBoss Data Grid. Although
their presentations are not up yet, you'll be able to download them from
http://www.redhat.com/summit/2012/presentations/jbossworld/[here].



I also met some Infinispan customers, such as Erik who's been using
Infinispan at a well known telecommunications company, or two of the
lead technical guys at a well known Geneva bank. We had some great
conversations where we were able to synch up our roadmap with them to
make sure any requirements they had are met in the future.



Of the presentations I attended, I was particularly impressed by Pete
and Marius' 10 minute demo on going from 0 to a fully fledged mobile
application running on top of AS7 in OpenShift in the "What's New in
Java Frameworks for Web, Cloud, & Mobile" BOF. I hope it was recorded
cos it was very impressive stuff.



It was a great week and once again it was a pleasure to be part of the
Red Hat Summit and JBoss World :)



Cheers,

Galder
