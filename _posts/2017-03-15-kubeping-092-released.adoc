I'm happy to announce a new release of _KUBE_PING_ JGroups protocol.

Since this is a minor maintenance release, there are no ground breaking
changes but we fixed a couple of issues that prevented our users from
using JGroups 3.6.x and KUBE_PING 0.9.1.

Have a look at the
https://github.com/jgroups-extras/jgroups-kubernetes/releases[release
page] to learn more details.

The artifacts should be available in Maven Central as soon as the sync
completes. In the meantime grab them from
https://origin-repository.jboss.org/nexus/content/repositories/public-jboss/org/jgroups/kubernetes/parent/0.9.2/[JBoss
Repository].
