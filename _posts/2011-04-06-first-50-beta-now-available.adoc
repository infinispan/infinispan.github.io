We've just released our first beta version of Infinispan 5.0 "Pagoa".
The main highlight in this release is the introduction of our brand new
Map/Reduce API to compliment the existing distributed executor API
release in a previous alpha version. We had countless discussions around
these APIs and the result can be see in our
http://docs.jboss.org/infinispan/5.0/apidocs/org/infinispan/distexec/mapreduce/package-frame.html[javadocs]
and this http://community.jboss.org/docs/DOC-15622[wiki] which explains
the distributed executor and Map/Reduce framework. Please download the
http://sourceforge.net/projects/infinispan/files/infinispan/5.0.0.BETA1/[5.0.0.BETA1]
distribution and play with it! Your feedback is invaluable at this stage
as we start to aim towards CR and Final release.



In other news, the query API has received a major overhaul and apart
from providing a more intuitive and powerful API, it hooks into
Hibernate Search new SPI making it easier to maintain. Infinispan users
now get access to
http://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/search/3.4/reference/en-US/html/search-query.html#d0e5541[Faceting]
via Hibernate Search as well. A revision of the Infinispan Querying wiki
is on its way, but the javadocs available
http://docs.jboss.org/infinispan/5.0/apidocs/org/infinispan/query/package-summary.html[here]
are full pointers to get you going.



Finally, here's a few notes on other interesting improvements:

* Distribution uses now MurmurHash3 hash function which is more
performant and provides more even spread.
* EmbeddedCacheManager has been enhanced with some new methods that
allow caches
http://docs.jboss.org/infinispan/5.0/apidocs/org/infinispan/manager/EmbeddedCacheManager.html#removeCache(java.lang.String)[to
be removed] all together. That is, remove the contents of a cache
cluster wide and in the persistent store. A couple of other methods to
go along with this have been added such as
http://docs.jboss.org/infinispan/5.0/apidocs/org/infinispan/manager/EmbeddedCacheManager.html#cacheExists(java.lang.String)[cacheExists()]
and
http://docs.jboss.org/infinispan/5.0/apidocs/org/infinispan/manager/EmbeddedCacheManager.html#getCache(java.lang.String,%20boolean)[a
conditional getCache()] that can inform the user when the cache has been
completely been removed the system.
* Increased performance of Hot Rod client/server architectures as a
result of fixing a couple of issues, one in the Hot Rod client and
another in the server, so if you're a Hot Rod user, make sure you
upgrade!

There's some other minor API changes and fixes as show in the
https://issues.jboss.org/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?projectId=12310799&version=12313467[release
notes]. As always, please use the

feedback coming.
