Migrating projects from one container to another is often problematic.
Not as much with Infinispan. This article is about configuring
Infinispan, using Transaction Manager for demarcating transaction
boundaries, while keeping the data both in a memory and relational
database - stored via JDBC cache store. I'll demonstrate all the
features on code snippets. 

A complete application is located at
https://github.com/mgencur/infinispan-examples and is called
carmart-tx-jdbc. It's a web application based on JSF 2, Seam 3 and
Infinispan 5.1.4.FINAL, is fully working, tested with JBoss  Application
Server 7.1.1.Final and Tomcat 7.0.27. There  is one prerequisite,
though. It needs an installed and working MySQL database in your system.
The database name should be carmartdb, accessible by a user with
carmart/carmart username/password.
 
First, look at what we need to configure for JBoss Application Server
7. 

== Configuring transactions and JDBC cache store on JBoss AS 7 

Infinispan will be configured via new fluent API using builders, hence
the call to  .build() method at the end. We need to configure aspects
related to  transactions and cache loaders. The configuration API for
cache loaders  is likely going to be changed in not-so-far future. It
should be fluent  and more intuitive, generally easier to use than
current one. 

I purposely do not show XML configuration. Configuration examples can be
found at
https://github.com/infinispan/infinispan/blob/master/core/src/main/resources/config-samples/sample.xml.
In order to configure transactions and cache loaders, look for tags
called  <transaction> and <loaders> and modify that sample file
according to below configuration. Tag names and attribute names are very
similar for both XML and Java configuration. If that is not enough,
there is always a schema in Infinispan distribution.

The configuration of Infinispan is as follows: 



Lines marked with red are different in other containers/configurations,
as you'll see in a minute. The code above implies that we need to
specify proper TransactionManagerLookup implementation which is, in this
case, GenericTransactionManagerLookup. We  also need to say: "Hey, I
wanna use ManagedConnectionFactory as a connectionFactoryClass". OK,
here we go. I should, as well, explain how to configure a datasource
properly, right? In JBoss AS 7, this is configured as a subsystem in
$JBOSS_HOME/standalone/configuration/standalone.xml:



The usage of transactions is very simple as we can obtain a transaction
object by injection.

Quite easy, isn't it ...if you know how to do it. The only problem is
that it does not work (at least not completely) :-) If you deploy the
app, you find out that when storing a key-value pair in  the cache, an
exception is thrown. This exception indicates that the operation with DB
(and JDBC cache store) failed. The exception says:



A complete stack trace looks similar to
https://gist.github.com/2777348
There's still an open issue in JIRA (ISPN-604) and it is being worked
on. 

== Configuring transactions and JDBC cache store on JBoss AS 7 - c3p0

But how do we cope with this inconvenience for now... By not using a
managed datasource but rather a third party library called c3p0 (JDBC3 
Connection and Statement Pooling, more information at
http://www.mchange.com/projects/c3p0/index.html) Infinispan allows you
to use this library for connecting to the database. If you really want
to use it, you need to choose a different connectionFactoryClass which
is, in this case, PooledConnectionFactory.

Infinispan configuration looks like this:


Transactions are accessible in the same way as in the previous use case.
Now let's look at configuration for Tomcat servlet container. 


== Configuring transactions and JDBC cache store on Tomcat 7

Tomcat does not have any Transaction Manager in it so we have to bundle
one with the application. For the purpose of this exercise, we choose
JBoss Transactions (http://www.jboss.org/jbosstm). See dependencies at
the end.

Cache manager and cache configuration is in this form:



For Tomcat, we need to specify a different transactionManagerLookup
implementation and datasourceJndiLocation. Tomcat simply places objects 
under a bit different JNDI locations. The datasource is defined in
context.xml file which has to be on classpath. This file might look like
this:



How do we get the transaction manager in the application then? Lets
obtain  it directly from a cache. 

Infinispan knows how to find the manager and we need to know how to
obtain it from Infinispan.



Sources:
https://github.com/mgencur/infinispan-examples/blob/master/carmart-tx-jdbc/src/tomcat/java/org/infinispan/examples/carmart/session/CarManager.java
The transaction manager provides standard methods for transactions, such
as begin(), commit() and rollback(). 


== *Now is the time for dependencies*

So...which dependencies do we always need when using Infinispan with
JDBC cache stores and transactions? These are infinspan-core,
infinispan-cachestore-jdbc and javax.transaction.jta. The scope for jta
dependency, as defined in Maven, is different for JBossAS and Tomcat.

*Common dependencies for JBossAS and Tomcat*



Of course, our application needs a few more dependencies but these are
not directly related to Infinispan. Let's ignore them in this article.
JBoss AS 7 provides managed datasource that is accessible from
Infinispan. The only specific dependency (related to transactions or
Infinispan) is JTA.

*Dependencies specific to JBossAS - using managed Datasource (managed by
the server)*



*Dependencies specific to JBossAS - using c3p0*



Yes, you need to bundle also MySQL connector. On the other hand, for
Tomcat use case and JBossAS with managed datasource, this jar file needs
do be deployed to the server separately. For Tomcat, do this simply by
copying the jar file to $TOMCAT_HOME/lib.  For JBoss AS 7, copy the jar
file into $JBOSS_HOME/standalone/deployments.

*Dependencies specific to Tomcat - using JBoss Transactions*



That's it. I hope you've found this article helpful. Any feedback is
welcome, especially the positive one :-) If you find any problem with
the  application, feel free to comment here or participate in Infinispan
forums (http://www.jboss.org/infinispan/forums).
