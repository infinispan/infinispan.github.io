I've just released Infinispan 4.0.0.ALPHA5. Yes, I know you were
expecting Beta1 already, but it is taking a little longer than
anticipated. Anyway, Alpha5 has got some cool new stuff you'd definitely
want to check out.

* Migration scripts for EHCache
* Internal performance improvements
* Newer, faster JBoss Marshalling

As you know, your feedback is important to us, so please do download and
try out what will hopefully be the last Alpha before we start releasing
Betas.

A full changelog is on
https://jira.jboss.org/jira/secure/ConfigureReport.jspa?versions=12313680&sections=.1.7.2.4.10.9.8.3.12.11.5&style=text&selectedProjectId=12310799&reportKey=pl.net.mamut%3Areleasenotes&Next=Next[JIRA],
and this release can be downloaded on our
http://www.jboss.org/infinispan/downloads[downloads] page.

Cheers
Manik
