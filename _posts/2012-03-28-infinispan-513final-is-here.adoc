Infinispan 5.1.3.FINAL is out now after having received very positive
feedback on 5.1.3.CR1 and fixing some other issues on top of that, such
as the https://issues.jboss.org/browse/ISPN-1936[file cache store
leaving files open], https://issues.jboss.org/browse/ISPN-1943[improving
standalone Infinispan Memcached implementation performance], and
https://issues.jboss.org/browse/ISPN-1937[including Infinispan CDI
extension jars in our distribution].

"Release early, release often", that's out motto, so we'll carry on
taking feedback onboard and releasing new Infinispan versions where we
improve on what we've done in the past apart from coming out with new
goodies.

Thanks to everyone, both users who have been getting in touch to provide
their feedback and developers who have been quickly reacting to users
fixing issues and implementing requested features.

Full details of what has been fixed in FINAL (including CR1) can be
found https://issues.jboss.org/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?projectId=12310799&version=12319209[here],
and if you have feedback, please
visit http://community.jboss.org/en/infinispan?view=discussions[our
forums]. Finally, as always, you can download the release
from http://www.jboss.org/infinispan/downloads[here].

Cheers,
Galder
