Dear Infinispan community,

We're proud to announce the first Beta release of Infinispan 7.1.0.

Infinispan brings the following major improvements:

* Near-Cache support for Remote HotRod caches
* Annotation-based generation of ProtoBuf serializers which removes the
need to write the schema files by hand and greatly improves usability of
Remote Queries
* Cluster Listener Event Batching, which coalesces events for better
performance
* Cluster- and node-wide aggregated statistics
* Vast improvements to the indexing performance
* Support for domain mode and the security vault in the server
* Further improvements to the Partition Handling with many stability
fixes and the removal of the Unavailable mode: a cluster can now be
either Available or Degraded.

Of course there's also the usual slew of bug fixes, performance and
memory usage improvements and documentation cleanups.
