= Infinispan 16.0.5

We don't usually blog about micros... but this is the second time in as many days that I have to break with tradition.

== Serious ProtoStream bug with Latin1 strings

If you were using strings that could be represented as Latin1/ISO-8859-1 in your protocol buffer payloads, ProtoStream
was corrupting them. ASCII and full UTF-8 were fine. We've now fixed this bug. Thanks
https://github.com/sf-db[Sergey Filipkov] for reporting this.

== Java serialization failure to serialize some collections

Another marshalling bug was affecting Java serialization of some collection types. Thanks https://github.com/ratoaq2[Rato]
for reporting this

== Release notes

You can look at the https://github.com/infinispan/infinispan/releases/tag/16.0.5[release notes] to see what was changed
since our previous release.
