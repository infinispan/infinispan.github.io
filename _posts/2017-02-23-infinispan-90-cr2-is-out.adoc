Dear community.

We are one step closer to the final release of Infinispan 9: we gladly
announce the release of Infinispan 9.0.0.CR2.


== The highlights of this release are:

Many dependencies have been upgraded to the latest and greatest:

* JGroups 4.0.0.Final
* Apache Lucene 5.5.4
* Hibernate Search 5.7.0.Final
* Protostream 4.0.0.Alpha7 

Transactional caches changes:

* Removed asynchronous configuration since it won't be supported
anymore.
* Introduced EmbeddedTransactionManager: a basic transaction manager
implementation.

Query now supports java.time.Instant natively

Changes in the configuration;

Significant performance improvements for embedded and client/server
mode;

And finally, quite a few bug fixes preparing us for the final release !
