I've just released Infinispan 4.1.0.CR2, codenamed _Radegast_.  Why is
this release so important?  Because it is very close to the final
version of the http://community.jboss.org/docs/DOC-14421[Hot Rod] wire
protocol, and the http://community.jboss.org/docs/DOC-15356[client] and
http://community.jboss.org/docs/DOC-15093[server] modules that sit on
either end of Hot Rod, allowing remote and non-JVM access to the data
grid.  Further, the memached protocol - along with the ability to make
use of any existing memcached client - is also supported.



Since the last release candidate, a number of important bugs - as
reported by you, the community - have been addressed, all details
available on
https://jira.jboss.org/secure/ConfigureReport.jspa?atl_token=XbNWY4zD1M&versions=12315146&sections=.1.7.2.4.10.9.8.3.12.11.5&style=none&selectedProjectId=12310799&reportKey=org.jboss.labs.jira.plugin.release-notes-report-plugin:releasenotes&Next=Next[this
release note report].



Thanks go out to the community for contributions, lots of testing and
feedback, and given that I hope this to be the last release candidate
before a final release of 4.1.0, I'm counting on even more feedback,
etc. for this release.  Keep 'em coming, people! :-)



The release is available on
https://sourceforge.net/projects/infinispan/[Sourceforge], please use
the http://community.jboss.org/en/infinispan?view=discussions[user
forums] for questions and https://jira.jboss.org/browse/ISPN[JIRA] to
report issues.



Enjoy!
Manik
