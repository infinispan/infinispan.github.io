Living up to the credo of "Release early, release often" we are
releasing 7.2.2.Final to our community today. This release does not
include any new features, but it has resolutions for the minor bugs we
have found since we released 7.2.1.Final.

You can see the list
of https://issues.jboss.org/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?projectId=12310799&version=12327278[fixed
issues] on our issue
tracker.  https://infinispan.org/download/[Download] the release and check
