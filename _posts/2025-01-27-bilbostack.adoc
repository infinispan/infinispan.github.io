= Bilbostack Conference

This weekend, I had the honor of speaking about In-Memory Databases at https://bilbostack.com/[BilboStack] in Bilbao, Spain.
It was a special moment for me because Bilbao is my hometown, where I completed
my Software Engineering studies 20 years ago. Public speaking
is always a challenge, but presenting in my hometown came with the added
pressure of not wanting to disappoint.

BilboStack is a 1000 attendees tech event featuring two tracks with four talks each in
the morning, followed by networking sessions in the afternoon.
This year marked its 13th edition. https://www.linkedin.com/posts/bart-farrell_bilbostack-activity-7289558740582748160-P2dl?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop[Here is a short video of the conference].

== What did I talk about?
I spoke about In-Memory Databases. One of their main use cases is caching and session replication, so I explained
the basics of distributed caching.

I covered:

* Embedded caching  with a library.
* Embedded distributed caching, which works across multiple systems.
* Using an in-memory database to keep applications stateless while managing
caching through the database, making it easy to scale cpu or memory up or down.

I also highlighted use cases such as real-time statistics, fast operations,
and implementing security and backups for cross-site deployments
(spanning multiple data centers).

The talk was very well received, and I got great feedback.
I kept the content general but also showcased how Infinispan,
the open-source product I work on, fits these scenarios.

== Demo and Slides
Demo and slides are available in this repository:

== Questions
I got many questions, but we did not have time to answered them.
Here are some of them, others will be answered in more detailed blog posts.

=== Can Infinispan be compared to Redis?
Yes, Infinispan is a competitor to Redis and can even act as a drop-in
replacement. This allows you to continue using your existing applications
and clients while switching to Infinispan. Tristan Tarrant’s video offers
a detailed comparison: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kb46QFigx84&t=1s[Redis vs Infinispan: Battle of the in-memory data stores].

=== Is "clear the cache" the new "restart your computer"?
It often feels that way! Caches—whether browser-based or tools like
Varnish—can trick us into thinking something is broken when it’s not.
Clearing the cache is often a quick fix.

=== Can in-memory databases work with other languages or visualization tools?
Absolutely! In-memory databases support multiple programming languages via
clients or APIs. These databases (e.g., Infinispan, Redis, Couchbase)
also integrate with popular visualization tools and frameworks.

=== On Vector Databases
Vector databases are growing in popularity for AI use cases, but
in-memory databases like Infinispan have supported similar features for years.
For example, Infinispan uses Hibernate Search and Lucene for full-text queries, and
from Lucene 7.2, KNN/ANN searches, and vector indexing is supported too. This makes it easy to integrate with
tools like https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain[LangChain] without
needing a separate vector database.

== Final words
BilboStack was amazing! The conference, held in Bilbao, is all in Spanish and
was very well organized. Everything ran smoothly, and the Basque culture made
it extra special. There was great food, traditional dances, live music,
and plenty of chances to meet people and connect.

It’s not just a tech event — it’s an experience. The talks aren’t filmed because
what happens at BilboStack stays there. You really have to be there to enjoy it fully!
A huge thank you to the organizers for treating us, as speakers, so incredibly well.
The effort and care they put into making us feel welcome and valued are like nowhere
else. It was an honor to be part of such a well-organized and thoughtful event.
Thank you for everything!

See you soon Bilbao, and see you next year Bilbostack! Next time, in San Mamés!
