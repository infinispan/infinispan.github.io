The latest beta in the Infinispan 5.1 "Brahma" series is out. So, what's
in Infinispan 5.1.0.BETA4? Here are the highlights:

* A hugely important lock acquisition improvement has been implemented
that results in locks being acquired in only a single node in the
cluster. This means that deadlocks as a result of multiple nodes
updating the same key are no longer possible. Concurrent updates on a
single key will now be queued in the node that 'owns' that key. For more
info, please check the http://community.jboss.org/docs/DOC-16974[design
wiki] and keep an eye on this blog because Mircea Markus, who's the
author of this enhancement, will be explaining it in more detail very
shortly. Please note that you don't need to make any configuration or
code changes to take advantage of this improvement.
* A bunch of classes and interfaces in the core/ module have been
migrated to an api/ and commons/ module in order to reduce the size of
the dependencies that the https://docs.jboss.org/author/x/NgY5[Hot Rod
Java client] had. As a result, there's been a change in the hierarchy of
http://docs.jboss.org/infinispan/5.1/apidocs/org/infinispan/Cache.html[Cache]
and
http://docs.jboss.org/infinispan/5.1/apidocs/org/infinispan/manager/CacheContainer.html[CacheContainer]
classes, with the introduction of
http://docs.jboss.org/infinispan/5.1/apidocs/org/infinispan/BasicCache.html[BasicCache]
and
http://docs.jboss.org/infinispan/5.1/apidocs/org/infinispan/manager/BasicCacheContainer.html[BasicCacheContainer],
which are parent classes of existing Cache and CacheContainer classes
respectively. What's important is that Hot Rod clients must now code
againts BasicCache and BasicCacheContainers rather than Cache and
CacheContainer. So previous code that was written like this will no
longer compile:
[source,java]
----
import org.infinispan.Cache;
import org.infinispan.manager.CacheContainer;
import org.infinispan.client.hotrod.RemoteCacheManager;
...
CacheContainer cacheContainer = new RemoteCacheManager();
Cache cache = cacheContainer.getCache();
----
Instead, if Hot Rod clients want to continue using interfaces higher up
the hierarchy from the remote cache/container classes, they'll have to
write:
[source,java]
----
import org.infinispan.BasicCache;
import org.infinispan.manager.BasicCacheContainer;
import org.infinispan.client.hotrod.RemoteCacheManager;
...
BasicCacheContainer cacheContainer = new RemoteCacheManager();
BasicCache cache = cacheContainer.getCache();
----
Previous code that interacted against the
http://docs.jboss.org/infinispan/5.1/apidocs/org/infinispan/client/hotrod/RemoteCache.html[RemoteCache]
and
http://docs.jboss.org/infinispan/5.1/apidocs/org/infinispan/client/hotrod/RemoteCacheManager.html[RemoteCacheManager]
should work as it used to:
[source,java]
----
import org.infinispan.client.hotrod.RemoteCache;
import org.infinispan.client.hotrod.RemoteCacheManager;
...
RemoteCacheManager cacheContainer = new RemoteCacheManager();
RemoteCache cache = cacheContainer.getCache();
----
We apologise for any inconvenience caused, but we think that the Hot Rod
clients will hugely benefit from this vastly reducing the number of
dependencies they need.
* Finally, a few words about the ZIP distribution file. In BETA4 we've
added some cache store implementations that were missing from previous
releases, such as the
http://docs.jboss.org/infinispan/5.1/apidocs/org/infinispan/loaders/remote/RemoteCacheStore.html[RemoteCacheStore]
that talks to https://docs.jboss.org/author/x/OgY5[Hot Rod servers], and
we've added a brand new demo application that implements a near-caching
pattern using JMS. Please be aware that this demo is just a simple
prototype of how near caches could be built using Infinispan and
HornetQ.


As always, please keep the
http://community.jboss.org/en/infinispan?view=discussions[feedback]
coming. You can http://www.jboss.org/infinispan/downloads[download] the
release from here and you get further details on the issues addressed in
the
https://issues.jboss.org/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?projectId=12310799&version=12318437[changelog].

Cheers,
