== Infinispan and Keycloak in a nutshell

==== About Infinispan
Infinispan is an open-source, in-memory distributed key/value data store. It is designed to provide fast
and scalable access to frequently accessed data by storing it in memory. In addition to caching,
Infinispan offers features for data distribution, replication, and partitioning, making it suitable
for use in distributed and clustered environments.

Infinispan is often used in scenarios where low-latency access to data is critical, such as caching
frequently accessed database queries, session data in web applications, or other
use cases where quick access to data can improve overall system performance

==== About Keycloak
https://www.keycloak.org/[Keycloak] is an open-source identity and access management solution developed by Red Hat.
It provides functionalities for identity and access management, including features like single sign-on (SSO),
user authentication, authorization, and user federation. Keycloak is designed to simplify the implementation
of security protocols and standards such as OAuth 2.0, OpenID Connect, and SAML.
Some key features include Single Sign-On (SSO), Identity Brokering, User Authentication,
User Federation, RBAC and more.


==== Infinispan and Keycloak
Keycloak uses Infinispan as its underlying data store for caching and storage purposes.
Infinispan provides  scalable and efficient caching of authentication and authorization-related data.
This helps improve performance and responsiveness, especially in scenarios where quick access to user
session information and other identity-related data is crucial.

Some ways *Keycloak leverages Infinispan* include Caching User Sessions, storing Authorization policies,
providing distributed caching, improving performance, https://www.keycloak.org/2023/12/recover-site-failures[failover recovering]
and more.

==== What about Infinispan leveraging Keycloak ?
Infinispan provides several ways to handle authentication and user management.
By default, the security realm is properties based. However, token based authentication is supported
and Keycloak can be used for that purpose.

== Creating a Security Realm in Keycloak

=== Run Keycloak in dev mode
The easiest way to use Keycloak on your laptop is in a container using the development mode.
Because we're going to run Keycloak in one container and Infinispan in another, let's set up
a network to connect them.

For Linux users, there's an option called *network_mode: host* that might be available
to you instead of using a network bridge. However, since this option doesn't work for
Mac or Windows currently, we'll focus on the method that suits all operating systems.

[source, bash]
----
docker network create -d bridge mynetwork
docker run -p 8080:8080 --network=mynetwork --name=keycloak -e KEYCLOAK_ADMIN=keycloak -e KEYCLOAK_ADMIN_PASSWORD=keycloak quay.io/keycloak/keycloak:latest start-dev
----

Keycloak Image will create an administrator user by defining the KEYCLOAK_ADMIN and KEYCLOAK_ADMIN_PASSWORD
environment variables.

After getting the container up and running, go to http://localhost:8080[http://localhost:8080]
Click on the Administration Console link, and log in using the credentials *"keycloak/keycloak"*.

=== Create a realm
Keycloak realms are a fundamental concept in Keycloak. Realms in Keycloak serve as a way to
isolate and manage different sets of users, applications, and their associated configurations.

Using the web administration tool, create a new realm called *"Infinispan"*.
This realm is what the Infinispan Server will use in the later steps of this tutorial.

[caption="Keycloak: create realm",link=/assets/images/blog/2024-01-09-infinispan-secured-keycloak/createRealmKeycloak.png]
image::/assets/images/blog/2024-01-09-infinispan-secured-keycloak/createRealmKeycloak.png[Keycloak create realm, 200, 192]

Name your realm *“infinispan”*.

image::/assets/images/blog/2024-01-09-infinispan-secured-keycloak/infinispanRealmKeycloak.png[Keycloak: realm name is infinispan, 800, 569]

=== Create the Infinispan clients
Clients are entities that can request authentication of a user. Clients come in two forms.
The first type of client is an application that wants to participate in single-sign-on.
These clients just want Keycloak to provide security for them. The other type of client is one that
is requesting an access token so that it can invoke other services on behalf of the authenticated user.

For the Infinispan Server and testing the Console security, we'll require two clients set up
in Keycloak: one named *"infinispan-console"* and the other *"infinispan-server"*.

==== Infinispan Console Client
Create a Keycloak client named *“infinispan-console”*. The Infinispan Web Console uses this client
to authenticate console users with Keycloak in order to obtain an authentication token. This token is
then used to authenticate all requests by the console to the Infinispan server.


[caption="Keycloak: infinispan-console client step 1",link=/assets/images/blog/2024-01-09-infinispan-secured-keycloak/infinispan-client-stepOne.png]
image::/assets/images/blog/2024-01-09-infinispan-secured-keycloak/infinispan-client-stepOne.png[Keycloak: infinispan-console client step 1, 800, 377]

Configure the valid redirect URIs with Infinispan’s console URI: *http://localhost:11222*

[caption="Keycloak: infinispan-console client step 2",link=/assets/images/blog/2024-01-09-infinispan-secured-keycloak/infinispan-client-stepTwo.png]
image::/assets/images/blog/2024-01-09-infinispan-secured-keycloak/infinispan-client-stepTwo.png[Keycloak: infinispan-console client step 2, 800, 503]

This step is completed.

==== Infinispan Server Client
Create a second client called *"infinispan-server"*. Set *"client authentication"* to *"ON"*.
This defines the type of the OIDC client. When it's ON, the OIDC type is set to confidential
access type. When it's OFF, it is set to public access type ("infinispan-console" client type).

[caption="Keycloak: infinispan-server client step 2",link=/assets/images/blog/2024-01-09-infinispan-secured-keycloak/infinispan-server-client-stepTwo.png]

This step is completed.

=== Create a user
Once we have the two clients created, we need to create an admin user for Infinispan.

Click on the *"users"* menu, and create a user named *"admin"*.

[caption="Keycloak: create admin",link=/assets/images/blog/2024-01-09-infinispan-secured-keycloak/createAdminUser.png]
image::/assets/images/blog/2024-01-09-infinispan-secured-keycloak/createAdminUser.png[Keycloak: create admin, 800, 448]

Once the user admin is created, navigate to the user detail page.

[caption="Keycloak: admin detail",link=/assets/images/blog/2024-01-09-infinispan-secured-keycloak/adminDetailKeycloak.png]
image::/assets/images/blog/2024-01-09-infinispan-secured-keycloak/adminDetailKeycloak.png[Keycloak: admin detail, 800, 575]

In the credentials tab, create a password for the user, for example, *"adminPassword"*.

[caption="Keycloak: admin set password",link=/assets/images/blog/2024-01-09-infinispan-secured-keycloak/adminSetAPasswordKeycloak.png]
image::/assets/images/blog/2024-01-09-infinispan-secured-keycloak/adminSetAPasswordKeycloak.png[Keycloak: admin set password, 500, 273]

We are now ready to run Infinispan.

== Running Infinispan secured with a Keycloak realm

=== Create the Infinispan security realm configuration
You can configure this in XML, JSON, or YAML. In the example provided below, the configuration
is in YAML format.

Create a file named *infinispan-token-realm.yaml* with the following content.

*infinispan-token-realm.yaml*
----
server:
 security:
   securityRealms:
     - name: default
       tokenRealm:
         name: infinispan
         authServerUrl: 'http://keycloak:8080'
         client-id: infinispan-console
         oauth2Introspection:
           clientId: infinispan-server
           clientSecret: 'COPY AND PASTE THE SECRET FROM KEYCLOAK'
           introspectionUrl: 'http://keycloak:8080/realms/infinispan/protocol/openid-connect/token/introspect'
----
We are not done yet!!

Read the following sections to understand and *change the placeholders* in the file.

==== Default Security Realm name
The security realm is named *"default"*. This file is designed to replace the default security realm
in Infinispan, which is originally based on properties, with the configuration for this
token-based realm.

==== Client Secret
Retrieve the secret for the *"infinispan-server"* client from the Keycloak Administration,
and then paste the secret value into the file replacing *'COPY AND PASTE THE SECRET FROM KEYCLOAK'*.

[caption="Keycloak: grab secret",link=/assets/images/blog/2024-01-09-infinispan-secured-keycloak/grabSecretFromInfinispanServerClient.png]
image::/assets/images/blog/2024-01-09-infinispan-secured-keycloak/grabSecretFromInfinispanServerClient.png[Keycloak: grab secret, 800, 465]

==== Authentication Server URL - *authServerUrl*
The authentication server is Keycloak, and it's running at *localhost:8080*. However, in the YAML
configuration above, we used *"keycloak"* instead of "localhost" (the container name).
This adjustment is needed when running containers in a Docker network. The Infinispan Server
will be reaching out to the Keycloak Server inside the Docker environment. As mentioned earlier,
Linux users can use "localhost" with the *network_mode: host* configuration.

=== Run the Infinispan Server overriding the default security realm
Lets run Infinispan in a container providing the created security realm configuration.

[source, bash]
----
docker run -it -p 11222:11222 -v $(pwd):/user-config
--network=mynetwork
--name=infinispan quay.io/infinispan/server:15.0
-c infinispan.xml
-c /user-config/infinispan-token-realm.yaml
----

The command:

* *Creates a volume "user-config"* in the current directory where we created the file `infinispan-token-realm.yaml`
* *Attaches the container to the network "mynetwork"* so Infinispan and Keycloak can connect
* *Uses `-c`*, which means the container is using the default configuration file, `infinispan.xml`.
Yet, specifying another `-c` file, it adds the content of `infinispan-token-realm.yaml` to `infinispan.xml`.
Since this file configures the default security realm, the original Infinispan default properties realm
will be replaced with the token-based realm.

=== Verify the changes
Accessing the following URL provides the information used by the Infinispan Web console
to handle authentication.

http://localhost:11222/rest/v2/login?action=config
[source, json]
----
{
   "mode": "OIDC",
   "clientId": "infinispan-console",
   "ready": "true",
   "realm": "infinispan",
   "url": "http://keycloak:8080"
}
----

The Infinispan Console will use the information above, and making use of the
https://www.keycloak.org/docs/latest/securing_apps/index.html#_javascript_adapter[Keycloak Javascript Adapter],
the interface  will redirect to Keycloak for user authentication.

=== Connect to the console with the admin user
Go the console web URL: http://localhost:11222

==== This site can’t be reached
The console needs to access Keycloak from outside the container.
However, the realm configuration uses `keycloak` host.

[caption="Site not reached",link=/assets/images/blog/2024-01-09-infinispan-secured-keycloak/siteNotReached.png]
image::/assets/images/blog/2024-01-09-infinispan-secured-keycloak/siteNotReached.png[Site not reached, 400, 263]


To avoid this issue, the workaround is simple: add to the following line to the `/etc/hosts` file:
----
 127.0.0.1      keycloak
----

As mentioned before, If you are using linux you can avoid this by using localhost and running
both containers with network_mode: host.

==== Authenticate using Keycloak
When opening the Infinispan Console, Infinispan will attempt to make a call to a REST API
that requires authentication. You'll be redirected to the Keycloak authentication, where you
should use the credentials *admin/adminPassword*. When you initially connect as admin,
you'll be prompted to change the password. For this example, you can stick with "adminPassword".

[caption="Infinispan: authenticate with Keycloak",link=/assets/images/blog/2024-01-09-infinispan-secured-keycloak/authenticateUsingKeycloak.png]
image::/assets/images/blog/2024-01-09-infinispan-secured-keycloak/authenticateUsingKeycloak.png[Infinispan: authenticate with Keycloak, 400, 258]

After Keycloak redirects back to the Infinispan Console, you can verify that admin is authenticated.
However, you will encounter Unauthorized errors in the console interface, since the connected
user’s roles are not known by Infinispan.

[caption="Infinispan: admin has not admin role",link=/assets/images/blog/2024-01-09-infinispan-secured-keycloak/adminIsNotAnAdmin.png]
image::/assets/images/blog/2024-01-09-infinispan-secured-keycloak/adminIsNotAnAdmin.png[Admin has not admin role, 800, 264]

=== Create and assign Infinispan ADMIN role
To grant complete access to the admin user, it's necessary to create a role named *"admin"*
and assign that role to the user in Keycloak.

==== Create the ADMIN role in Keycloak
Open the Keycloak administration interface, click on "Roles", and then create a role with the name
"admin".

[caption="Keycloak: create admin role",link=/assets/images/blog/2024-01-09-infinispan-secured-keycloak/createRoleAdminKeycloak.png]
image::/assets/images/blog/2024-01-09-infinispan-secured-keycloak/createRoleAdminKeycloak.png[Keycloak: create admin role, 800, 285]

==== Assign the ADMIN role in Keycloak
In the admin user detail page, go to the Role Mapping tab and assign the previously created
"admin" role there.

[caption="Keycloak: assign admin role to admin user",link=/assets/images/blog/2024-01-09-infinispan-secured-keycloak/asignAdminRoleToAdminUser.png]
image::/assets/images/blog/2024-01-09-infinispan-secured-keycloak/asignAdminRoleToAdminUser.png[Keycloak: assign admin role to admin user, 800, 361]

Return to the Infinispan Console, and you'll notice that the admin user is now granted the
admin role in Infinispan as well.

[caption="Infinispan: admin is granted",link=/assets/images/blog/2024-01-09-infinispan-secured-keycloak/adminIsGranted.png]
