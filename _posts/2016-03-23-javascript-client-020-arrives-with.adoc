Today https://www.npmjs.com/package/infinispan[Infinispan Javascript
client version 0.2.0] was released, which includes:


* Updated
https://github.com/infinispan/js-client/blob/master/README.md[README
file] containing simpler individual examples on each main feature set.
* Remote execution - Users can now load remote scripts into Infinispan
Servers using the addScript method and these scripts can be remotely
executed via the execute operation. An example of this can be found in
the https://github.com/infinispan/js-client/blob/master/README.md[README
file].
* Server-side statistic can now be retrieved using the stats operation.
Again, an example can be found in
the https://github.com/infinispan/js-client/blob/master/README.md[README
file].
* The client now supports cluster topology updates, so it can handle
remote notifications of server side topology changes, including addition
or removal of server-side cluster nodes.
* Using the cluster topology information and hashing algorithms, the
client can now apply the same Consistent-Hash algorithm servers use to
distribute data around the cluster, and hence can immediately locate the
server where a particular key lives.



If you're a Javascript user and want to store data remotely in
Infinispan Server instances, please give the client a go and tell us
what you think of it via our
https://developer.jboss.org/en/infinispan/content[forum], via our
https://issues.jboss.org/projects/ISPN[issue tracker] or via IRC on the
#infinispan channel on Freenode.



Cheers,

Galder
