http://www.jboss.org/events/JUDCon/2012/india[JUDCon India] is finished
now and I was hugely impressed with what I saw in the conference. First
of all, it was by far the biggest crowd I've seen in a JUDCon event so
that's excellent news. The more, the merrier :)

The attendants have been excellent and in general I felt that they were
paying more attention than in conferences in other countries. This is
partly because hardly any attendant had their laptops open while
listening to the presentations. They simply had a notebook and a pen or
pencil and they were taking just notes. I wished this would happen more
often in other conferences. Hmmm, time to ban laptops in non-interactive
presentations?

I ended up doing http://www.jboss.org/events/JUDCon/2012/india/agenda[4
presentations], 3 of them in Infinispan related topics and 1 talking
about JBoss Polyglot. Of all, the one that I felt attracted the most
attention was the one on near caches. I got a lot of positive feedback
from attendants and very interesting questions at the end of the
presentation.

In terms of organization, it was impecable. Wifi worked like a treat
with around 7 access points, 3/4 of which you could join from any place
in the conference. Food was good as well, if you like Indian cooking of
course :). As I already said on http://twitter.com/galderz[Twitter], the
toilets were... interesting for a westener :).

Finally, I must congratulate the organisers on the method used to
motivate attendants to provide feedback on the presentations. To get the
JUDCon t-shirt, attendants needed to fill in feedback forms for all
presentations they had attended, and once the last presentation had
finished, they could go and claim their t-shirt once they'd handed over
the feedback forms. I thought this was a fantastic idea to increase the
amount of feedback received. So, well done to organisers! Looking
forward to reading the feedback now.

Just landed in Delhi and now waiting for my colleague Rado, who's
arriving in a later flight from Bangalore. It's time now for a couple of
days off and doing a bit of touristy stuff around here. Plenty to see
and do in the next few days with the Republic Day military parade, visit
the Red Fort, Taj Mahal...etc.

Cheers,
Galder
