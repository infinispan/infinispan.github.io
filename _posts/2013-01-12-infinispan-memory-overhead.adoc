Have you ever wondered how much Java heap memory is actually consumed
when data is stored in Infinispan cache? Let's look at some numbers
obtained through real measurement.

The strategy was the following:

1) Start Infinispan server in local mode (only one server instance,
eviction disabled)
2) Keep calling full garbage collection (via JMX or directly via
System.gc() when Infinispan is deployed as a library) until the
difference in consumed memory by the running server gets under 100kB
between two consecutive runs of GC
3) Load the cache with *100MB* of data via respective client (or
directly store in the cache when Infinispan is deployed as a library)
4) Keep calling the GC until the used memory is stabilised
5) Measure the difference between the final values of consumed memory
after the first and second cycle of GC runs
6) Repeat steps 3, 4 and 5 four times to get an average value (first
iteration ignored)

The amount of consumed memory was obtained from a verbose GC log
(related JVM options: -verbose:gc -XX:+PrintGCDetails
-XX:+PrintGCTimeStamps -Xloggc:/tmp/gc.log)

The test output looks like this: https://gist.github.com/4512589

The operating system (Ubuntu) as well as JVM (Oracle JDK 1.6) were
64-bit. Infinispan 5.2.0.Beta6. Keys were kept intentionally small (10
character Strings) with byte arrays as values. The target entry size is
a sum of key size and value size.


== *Memory overhead of Infinispan accessed through clients*

== 


*HotRod client*


entry size -> overall memory

512B       -> 137144kB

1kB        -> 120184kB

10kB       -> 104145kB

1MB        -> 102424kB


So how much additional memory is consumed on top of each entry?


entry size/actual memory per entry -> overhead per entry

512B/686B                -> ~174B

1kB(1024B)/1202B         -> ~178B

10kB(10240B)/10414B      -> ~176B

1MB(1048576B)/1048821B   -> ~245B


*MemCached client (text protocol, SpyMemcached client) *


entry size -> overall memory

512B       -> 139197kB

1kB        -> 120517kB

10kB       -> 104226kB

1MB        -> N/A (SpyMemcached allows max. 20kB per entry)



entry size/actual memory per entry -> overhead per entry

512B/696B               -> ~184B

1kB(1024B)/1205B        -> ~181B

10kB(10240B)/10422B     -> ~182B



== 

*REST client (Content-Type: application/octet-stream)*


entry size -> overall memory

512B       -> 143998kB

1kB        -> 122909kB

10kB       -> 104466kB

1MB        -> 102412kB



entry size/actual memory per entry -> overhead per entry

512B/720B               -> ~208B

1kB(1024B)/1229B        -> ~205B

10kB(10240B)/10446B     -> ~206B

1MB(1048576B)/1048698B  -> ~123B


The memory overhead for individual entries seems to be more or less
constant
across different cache entry sizes.


== Memory overhead of Infinispan deployed as a library


Infinispan was deployed to http://www.jboss.org/jbossas[JBoss
Application Server 7] using http://arquillian.org/[Arquillian].


entry size -> overall memory/overall with storeAsBinary

512B       -> 132736kB / 132733kB

1kB        -> 117568kB / 117568kB

10kB       -> 103953kB / 103950kB

1MB        -> 102414kB / 102415kB


There was almost no difference in overall consumed memory when enabling
or disabling storeAsBinary.


entry size/actual memory per entry-> overhead per entry (w/o
storeAsBinary)

512B/663B               -> ~151B

1kB(1024B)/1175B        -> ~151B

10kB(10240B)/10395B     -> ~155B

1MB(1048576B)/1048719B  -> ~143B


As you can see, the overhead per entry is constant across different
entry sizes and is ~151 bytes.


== Conclusion


The memory overhead is slightly more than 150 bytes per entry when
storing data into the cache locally. When accessing the cache via remote
clients, the memory overhead is a little bit higher and ranges from ~170
to ~250 bytes, depending on remote client type and cache entry size. If
we ignored the statistics for 1MB entries, which could be affected by a
small number of entries (100) stored in the cache, the range would have
been even narrower.
