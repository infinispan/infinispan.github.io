We're getting close to releasing Infinispan 5.1 '_Brahma_', and today I
have the pleasure of announcing the Infinispan 5.1.0.CR1, our first
release candidate. So, what's in it?

* Ahead of future eventual consistency support, Infinispan now supports
versioned cache entries which means that existing write skew checks on
REPEATABLE_READ caches can be done more accurately.
* Support for CDI injection of remote caches! Thanks to excellent work
of community contributor Kevin Pollet, you can now inject remote caches
as well as embedded caches using CDI. Detailed documentation on how to
use is available https://docs.jboss.org/author/x/BAFZ[here]. In the mean
time, checkout the CDI integration module in the
https://github.com/infinispan/infinispan[Infinispan source code] for
examples.

Finally, we've introduced considerable new functionality in the previous
Infinispan 5.1 alpha/beta releases, and so this first release candidate
contains
https://issues.jboss.org/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?projectId=12310799&version=12318066[some
important fixes] for the newly introduced functionality, so if you're
using any previous alpha/beta releases, please
http://www.jboss.org/infinispan/downloads[upgrade asap] and provide us
some
http://community.jboss.org/en/infinispan?view=discussions[feedback]!



Cheers,
