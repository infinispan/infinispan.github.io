Dear all,

Today we are releasing 10.0.0.Alpha1 and 9.4.2.Final.

Infinispan 9.4.2.Final comes with a number of bug fixes and some small
additional features:


* https://issues.jboss.org/browse/ISPN-9655[ISPN-9655] REST Access Log
headers
* https://issues.jboss.org/browse/ISPN-8144[ISPN-8144] &
https://issues.jboss.org/browse/ISPN-9661[ISPN-9661] Cross-Site
replication statistics
* https://issues.jboss.org/browse/ISPN-9708[ISPN-9708] Expose the
executor services through JMX
* https://issues.jboss.org/browse/ISPN-9732[ISPN-9732] Local iteration
optimization with write behind is valid for non shared stores
* https://issues.jboss.org/browse/ISPN-9717[ISPN-9717] Fix Integer
overflow for lifespan and maxIdle


We have begun working on what will become Infinispan 10. As with all new
major releases, this will come with a number of important changes.


* *New Server*
We are working on a new lightweight server, currently dubbed _ServerNG_,
which will supersede the current WildFly-based offering. The new server
will have a smaller disk and memory footprint, a new RESTful admin
interface, improved security. It will still use familiar components
(Elytron for security, Narayana for transactions, etc) but we hope that
the installation and usability experience will be most improved. A
dedicated blog post will describe in detail what is coming.
* *Long-term Storage Format*
The persistent storage format will be changed so that it will be easier
to transparently make changes to it without requiring further
exporters/importers.
* *Non-blocking listeners*
The listener implementation will be replaced with a non-blocking
implementation.
* *Asynchronous CacheLoader/Store*
Store operations will be ran in another thread to provide non blocking
for main threads
* *Improved statistics*
Infinispan statistics have been traditionally over-simplistic, offering
mostly basic averages for writes and reads. We are going to implement
percentiles on a histogram as well as recording tracing information so
that you will be able to know how much time is being spent in the
various subsystems (clustering, persistence, etc.)
* *New API*
The current Infinispan API, based around Java's _ConcurrentHashMap_
design, does not offer the flexibility required to support modern
reactive designs as well as the various extensions we've added over the
years (counters, multimaps, etc). We are therefore working on a new
modern API design which we will be describing with a number of blog
posts in the near future.
* *Agroal JDBC Connection Pool*
We are replacing the JDBC connection pool implementation with
https://agroal.github.io/[Agroal].
* *Kubernetes Operators*
Operators are all the rage in the Kubernetes world, and we are working
on an Infinispan Operator which will take care of managing and
monitoring the health of an Infinispan cluster, handle scale up/scale
down safely, perform upgrades and more.


Infinispan 10.0.0.Alpha1 is the first release from our development
branch. It currently includes the following features on top of what is
in 9.4.2.Final:


* https://issues.jboss.org/browse/ISPN-9666[ISPN-9666] Agroal JDBC
Connection pool
* https://issues.jboss.org/browse/ISPN-9688[ISPN-9688] Internal REST
server modularization
