As a seasoned public speaker, I don't easily get flustered by minor
glitches that inevitably occur when presenting or doing live code demos.
 I expected a recent http://java.sun.com/community/usergroups/[JUG] and
http://www.jboss.org/usergroups[JBUG] tour of the American mid-west to
be no different. I was prepared to speak about
http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=107[JSR 107] and
http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=347[JSR 347],
http://www.infinispan.org/[Infinispan], and a wee bit on
http://ogm.hibernate.org/[Hibernate OGM] and NoSQL. All subjects I'm
pretty familiar with, totalling to about an hour of yacking. Followed by
a live coding demo to walk people through Infinispan's core API.
Simple.

where does one start when talking about what went embarrassingly wrong
at the http://www.wjug.org/madjug/[Madison Java User Group] on the 29th
of Feb? Well, I suppose mistaking my
http://store.apple.com/us/product/MC552ZM/B[iPad VGA connector] for the
http://store.apple.com/us/product/MB572Z/A[mini displayport to VGA
connector] for my MacBook when leaving London was a start. Mix in the
fact that this realisation only happened in a room full of people, with
a few minutes to go before the start of the talk. Nice. Unable to
connect my laptop to the projector, I had no choice but to present off
my iPad instead. Which was fine, except that ten minutes into my talk,
my iPad spuriously decided to shut down. Epic fail. But who needs
slides, right?  Not _me_, for sure - I'm way too cool for that.  So I
continued on, unfazed. Now try explaining
http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~brewer/[Eric Brewer]'s
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAP_theorem[CAP theorem] without any visual
aids. Fun, right? I tried to use the whiteboard. No pens! The organiser
rushed out to find some. And none of them worked! Even old-school
technology was failing on me that day.

Then come demo time, I was able to borrow a Linux laptop from Red Hatter
Jey Paulraj who was in the audience, and transfer my demo to it. Given
that the laptop didn't have the tools needed to actually run the demo,
the entire demo consisted of me just walking people through an
http://docs.jboss.org/infinispan/5.1/configdocs/[Infinispan
configuration XML file]. For half an hour. Suspenseful and thrilling!
Well, peppered with anecdotes about the life of an open source developer
and several tangents on the architecture of various parts of Infinispan,
the time did actually fly by (and the audience did seem at least
somewhat engaged!)

clincher, though - I had a PDF containing URLs where people could
download the demo, and learn more about the JSRs and Infinispan.
Bringing this PDF up on Jey's laptop, still projecting for the benefit
of the room, resulted in his PDF viewer crashing. That's when I threw in
the towel - any more information from me would require tequila,
preferably delivered intravenously!

Now for the moral of the story, don't trust technology. Always be
prepared to get your message across with no visual aids whatsoever. Oh,
and don't forget your Macbook's VGA adapter. :)

I repeated the talk a few times in Milwaukee and Chicago, and everything
ran really well - after a quick trip to the local Apple store to replace
my VGA adapter!

*[.underline]#Addendum 2:#* I now am on a short break climbing in the
Canadian Rockies, but will soon be presenting the same in Washington DC
- drop by if you're in the neighbourhood!
