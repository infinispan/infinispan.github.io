If you're following Infinispan's mailing lists you've probably caught a
glimpse of the new developments in the Query land: a new DSL, remote
querying via Hot Rod client, a new marshaller based on Google's
Protobuf. Time to unveil these properly!


==== 

==== The new Query DSL

==== 


Starting with version 6.0 Infinispan offers a new (experimental) way of
running queries against your cached entities based on a simple filtering
DSL. The aim of the new DSL is to simplify the way you write queries and
to be agnostic of the underlying query mechanism(s) making it possible
to provide alternative query engines in the future besides Lucene and
still being able to use the same query language/API. The previous
Hibernate Search & Lucene based
https://docs.jboss.org/author/display/ISPN/Querying+Infinispan[approach]
is still in place and will continue to be supported and in fact the new
DSL is currently implemented right on top of it. The future will surely
bring index-less searching based on map-reduce and possibly other new
cool search technologies.

Running DSL-based queries in embedded mode is almost identical to
running the existing Lucene-based queries. All you need to do is have
infinispan-query-dsl.jar and infinispan-query.jar in your classpath
(besides Infinispan and its dependecies), enable indexing for your
caches, annotate your POJO cache values and your're ready.

__

....
ConfigurationBuilder cfg = new ConfigurationBuilder();
cfg.indexing().enable();

DefaultCacheManager cacheManager = new DefaultCacheManager(cfg.build());

Cache cache = cacheManager.getCache();
....

____Alternatively, indexing (and everything else) can also be configured
via XML configuration, as already described in the user guide, so we'll
not delve into details here.

Your Hibernate Search annotated entity might look like this.

__

....
import org.hibernate.search.annotations.*;
...

@Indexed
public class User {

    @Field(store = Store.YES, analyze = Analyze.NO)
    private String name;

    @Field(store = Store.YES, analyze = Analyze.NO, indexNullAs = Field.DEFAULT_NULL_TOKEN)
    private String surname;

    @IndexedEmbedded(indexNullAs = Field.DEFAULT_NULL_TOKEN)
    private List addresses;

    // .. the rest omitted for brevity
}
....

____Running a DSL based query involves obtaining a
_https://github.com/infinispan/infinispan/blob/6.0.0.Beta1/query-dsl/src/main/java/org/infinispan/query/dsl/QueryFactory.java[QueryFactory]_
from the (cache scoped) _SearchManager_ and then constructing the query
as follows:

__

....
import org.infinispan.query.Search;
import org.infinispan.query.dsl.QueryFactory;
import org.infinispan.query.dsl.Query;
...

QueryFactory qf = Search.getSearchManager(cache).getQueryFactory();

Query q = qf.from(User.class)
    .having("name").eq("John")
    .toBuilder().build();

List list = q.list();

assertEquals(1, list.size());
assertEquals("John", list.get(0).getName());
assertEquals("Doe", list.get(0).getSurname());
....

____That's it! I'm sure this raised your curiosity as to what the DSL is
actually capable of so you might want to look at the list of supported
filter operators in
_https://github.com/infinispan/infinispan/blob/6.0.0.Beta1/query-dsl/src/main/java/org/infinispan/query/dsl/FilterConditionEndContext.java[FilterConditionEndContext]_.
Combining multiple conditions with boolean operators, including
sub-conditions, is also possible:


....
Query q = qf.from(User.class)
    .having("name").eq("John")
    .and().having("surname").eq("Doe")
    .and().not(qf.having("address.street").like("%Tanzania%").or().having("address.postCode").in("TZ13", "TZ22"))
    .toBuilder().build();
....


The DSL is pretty nifty right now and will surely be expanded in the
future based on your feedback. It also provides support for result
pagination, sorting, projections, embedded objects, all demonstrated in
_https://github.com/infinispan/infinispan/blob/6.0.0.Beta1/query/src/test/java/org/infinispan/query/dsl/embedded/QueryDslConditionsTest.java[QueryDslConditionsTest]_
which I encourage you to look at until the proper user guide is
published. Still, this is not a relational database, so keep in mind
that all queries are written in the scope of the _single_ targeted
entity (and its embedded entities). There are no joins (yet), no
correlated subqueries, no grouping or aggregations.

Moving further, probably the most exciting thing about the new DSL is
using it remotely via the Hot Rod client. But to make this leap we first
had to adopt a common format for storing our cache entries and
marshalling them over the wire that would also be cross-language and
robust enough to support evolving object schemas. But probably most of
all, this format had to have a schema rather than just being an opaque
blob otherwise indexing and searching are meaningless. Enter Protocol
Buffers.


==== The Protobuf marshaller


Configuring the _RemoteCacheManager_ of the Java Hot Rod client to use
it is straight forward:
__

....
import org.infinispan.client.hotrod.configuration.ConfigurationBuilder;
...

ConfigurationBuilder clientBuilder = new ConfigurationBuilder();
clientBuilder.addServer()
    .host("127.0.0.1").port(11234)
    .marshaller(new ProtoStreamMarshaller());
....

____Now you'll be able to store and get from the remote cache your
_User_ instaces encoded in protobuf format provided that:

1. a Protobuf type was declared for your entity in a _.proto_
https://github.com/infinispan/protostream/blob/1.0.0.Alpha6/sample-domain-definition/src/main/resources/bank.proto[file]
which was then compiled into a _.protobin_
https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/techniques?hl=ro#self-description[binary
descriptor]

2. the binary descriptor was registered with your _RemoteCacheManager_'s
_ProtoStreamMarshaller_ instance like this:
__

....
ProtoStreamMarshaller.getSerializationContext(remoteCacheManager)
    .registerProtofile("my-test-schema.protobin");
....

____3. a per-entity marshaller was registered:
__

....
ProtoStreamMarshaller.getSerializationContext(remoteCacheManager)
    .registerMarshaller(User.class, new UserMarshaller());
....

____Steps 2 and 3 are closely tied to the way
https://github.com/infinispan/protostream[Protosteam] library works,
which is pretty straight forward but cannot be detailed here. Having a
look at our
https://github.com/infinispan/protostream/blob/1.0.0.Alpha6/sample-domain-implementation/src/main/java/org/infinispan/protostream/sampledomain/marshallers/UserMarshaller.java[_UserMarshaller_]
sample should clear this up.

Keeping your objects stored in protobuf format has the benefit of being
able to consume them with compatible clients written in other languages.
But if this does not sound enticing enough probably the fact they can
now be easily indexed should be more appealing.


==== Remote querying via the Hot Rod client


Given a _RemoteCacheManager_ configured as previously described the next
steps to enable remote query over its caches are:

1. add the DSL jar to client's classpath,
infinispan-remote-query-server.jar to server's classpath and
infinispan-remote-query-client.jar to both
2. enable indexing in your cache configuration - same as for embedded
mode
3. register your protobuf binary descriptor by invoking the
'_registerProtofile_' method of the server's _ProtobufMetadataManager_
MBean (one instance per _EmbeddedCacheManager_)

All data placed in cache now is being indexed without the need to
annotate your entities for Hibernate Search. In fact these classes are
only meaningful to the Java client and do not even exist on the
server.

Running the queries over the Hot Rod client is now very similar to
embedded mode. The DSL is in fact the same. The only part that is
slightly different is how you obtain the _QueryFactory_:

__

....
import org.infinispan.client.hotrod.Search;
import org.infinispan.query.dsl.QueryFactory;
import org.infinispan.query.dsl.Query;
...

remoteCache.put(2, new User("John", "Doe", 33));

QueryFactory qf = Search.getQueryFactory(remoteCache);

Query query = qf.from(User.class)
    .having("name").eq("John")
    .toBuilder().build();

List list = query.list();
assertEquals(1, list.size());
assertEquals("John", list.get(0).getName());
assertEquals("Doe", list.get(0).getSurname());
....

__
