Ever since we started the Infinispan project, I simply don't recall a
time busier than the current one! As usual we're working on new features
and supporting our community and enterprise users, but on top of that
we're working on a big scale demo that we hope you are going to like
it!

All of that has been happening with at the same time juggling one of the
busiest periods in Infinispan evangelisation that I can remember! Here's
what I have been up to past month and a half:

On 18th of March I gave a brand new presentation at
https://www.javaland.eu/de/javaland-2018/[Javaland] where I explored the
Java RPC framework landscape. Since 2010, Infinispan has offered a
binary remote, client/server API for interacting with the data. As more
clients have been developed, we've been noticing that we're spending
more time that'd we'd like implementing features across different
clients. In this talk I looked at existing Java RPC frameworks from the
point of view of Infinispan's remote API requirements. If we were to
implement our binary protocol again, which option would fit best? The
spectrum can be very vast so I limited myself to some know options (HTTP
1.1 REST), some options we have expertise on (Netty), some upcoming
players (gRPC) and some lesser known but very powerful players (Aeron).
The talk was not recorded but the slides can be found here:




Javaland was a very enjoyable conference set in a theme park near
Cologne. The sessions were a mix in German and English. Although my
German is not very good, I was able to follow some of the sessions.

After Javaland, I turned my attention to http://devoxx.fr/[Devoxx
France] which was held in Paris mid-April. I had a couple of sessions at
Devoxx France. The first was a streaming data analysis 3 hour university
talk delivered along with https://twitter.com/clementplop[Clement
Escoffier] from the Vert.x team. We already delivered this session at
JFokus earlier this year, but at Devoxx France it was recorded so you'll
soon to be able to watch it! In the mean time, slides can be found
below:

On top of that, https://twitter.com/saturnism[Ray Tsang] from Google
joined Clement and I to deliver a 3 hour streaming data hands-on lab at
Devoxx France. This was the same workshop we delivered in Devoxx Belgium
and Codemotion Madrid in 2017. The big difference was that instead of
having the users run it locally on their laptops within a virtual
machine, they could run OpenShift and all the components inside of
https://cloud.google.com/[Google Cloud Platform]. The users had a better
experience as a result of not having to deal with a virtual machine :).
I'd like to say special thanks to Ray for the Google Cloud Platform test
accounts and the support during the workshop.

Finally, many thanks to all attendees that came to the sessions, and to
the organisers/sponsors for creating two outstanding events!

In the next blog post I'll be talking about Great Indian Developer
Summit and Voxxed Days Zurich. Stay tuned! :)

Cheers,
Galder
