Infinispan 5.2 will sport a much needed configuration overhaul which
will affect both the programmatic builder API and the declarative XML
parsing.

As you all know by now, 5.1 introduced a new fluent builder-based API
with immutable POJOs for configuring Infinispan's core. This coolness
however was not extended to all the extra modules available for
Infinispan (and there are quite a few of those), leaving them with a
simple untyped key/value properties-based configuration. This was
especially visible (and painful) when configuring the cache loaders,
some of which have a plethora of parameters and options.

In 5.2 modules become first-class citizens and can provide their own
builders and can take care of parsing their own XML for which they can
provide a custom schema (for editors/IDE which provide content-assist).
Modules can retrieve information from either the
http://docs.jboss.org/infinispan/5.2/apidocs/org/infinispan/configuration/global/GlobalConfiguration.html[GlobalConfiguration]
or the per-cache
http://docs.jboss.org/infinispan/5.2/apidocs/org/infinispan/configuration/cache/Configuration.html[Configuration]
objects via the T modules(Class<T> moduleClass) method.

Loaders and Stores also get this treatment. Look at the two _before_ and
_after_ configurations below for configuring the JDBC Cache Store.

Before:


After:


You will be able to check-out these features in Infinispan 5.2.0.Alpha3.
Bear in mind that at the time of writing not all cache loaders have been
migrated to this new configuration style, but they should all be
complete by the time 5.2.0.Final is released.
