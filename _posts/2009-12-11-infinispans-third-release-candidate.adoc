I'd happy to announce that after a long wait, we've finally released
Infinispan 4.0.0.CR3 - the latest and greatest in a series of release
candidates, which will hopefully be the last before we cut the final
release. As such, it is really important that you try out CR3 - test it,
stress it out, and provide as much feedback as possible on the
http://www.jboss.org/index.html?module=bb&op=viewforum&f=309[user
forums].



In this release, we've:

* Fixed the dependency issues on RHQ snapshots, which was causing
problems for several people
* Added the ability to configure the cache instance used by the REST
server
* Updated the query API so it is not restricted to String keys
* Loads more stuff

As always, the full set of changes are on
https://jira.jboss.org/jira/secure/ConfigureReport.jspa?versions=12314279&sections=.1.7.2.4.10.9.8.3.12.11.5&style=none&selectedProjectId=12310799&reportKey=pl.net.mamut:releasenotes&Next=Next[JIRA].
Download this release

Cheers
