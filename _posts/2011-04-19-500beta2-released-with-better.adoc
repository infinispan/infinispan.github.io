A brand new Infinispan 5.0 "Pagoa" beta is out now, 5.0.0.BETA2 bringing
even more goodies for Infinispan users:

* Initial implementation of virtual nodes for consistent hash algorithm
based distribution is included. This means that each Infinispan node can
now pick multiple nodes in the hash wheel reducing the standard
deviation and so improving the distribution of data. The configuration
is done via the
http://docs.jboss.org/infinispan/5.0/apidocs/org/infinispan/config/FluentConfiguration.HashConfig.html#numVirtualNodes(java.lang.Integer)[numVirtualNodes]
attribute in
_http://docs.jboss.org/infinispan/5.0/apidocs/config.html#ce_clustering_hash[hash]_
element.
* The externalizer configuration has been revamped in order to make it
more user-friendly! You only need the
http://docs.jboss.org/infinispan/5.0/apidocs/org/infinispan/marshall/SerializeWith.html[@SerializeWith]
annotation and an
http://docs.jboss.org/infinispan/5.0/apidocs/org/infinispan/marshall/Externalizer.html[Externalizer]
implementation in its most basic form, but more advanced externalizer
configuration is still available for particular use cases. The wiki on
plugging externalizers has been rewritten to show
http://community.jboss.org/docs/DOC-16198[these changes].
* _lazyDeserialization_ XML element has been renamed to
_*http://docs.jboss.org/infinispan/5.0/apidocs/config.html#ce_default_storeAsBinary[storeAsBinary]*_
in order to better represent its function. The previous programmatic
configuration for this option has been deprecated to help ease migration
but your XML will need changing.
* All references to JOPR, including the maven module name have been
renamed to RHQ. So bear make sure you plug your RHQ server with
_*infinispan-rhq-plugin.jar*_ instead of _infinispan-jopr-plugin.jar_

There's some other minor API changes and fixes as show in the
https://issues.jboss.org/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?projectId=12310799&version=12316193[release
notes]. As always, please use the

feedback coming.
