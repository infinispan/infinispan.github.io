Hi Infinispan Community,

our original plan was to release 9.4 Final today, but we have decided to
delay the release by an extra sprint (3 weeks).
So today we are announcing 9.4.0.CR3 instead, which comes with the
following fixes:


* Segmented off-heap data container
* Performance improvements for Near Caches
* Hot Rod client-side statistics
* Removal of the old compatibility mode in favor of the new transcoding
capabilities is now complete
* Server rebased on top of WildFly 14
* Lots of code cleanups, especially around query
* Bug fixes

For those of you on our stable branch, we also released a 9.3.3 with
some bug fixes.

name:
