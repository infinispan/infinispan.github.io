One of the questions we get asked a lot is: when will I be able to run
Map/Reduce and DistExec jobs over HotRod.

I'm happy to say: now !

Infinispan Server comes with Stored Script Execution which means that
remote clients can invoke named scripts on the server. If you're
familiar with the concept of Stored Procedures of the SQL world, then
you already have an idea of what this feature is about. The types of
scripts you can run are those handled by Java's scripting API. Out of
the box this means Javascript (which uses either the Nashorn engine on
JDK 8+), but you can add many more (Groovy, Scala, JRuby, Jython, Lua,
etc). Scripts are stored in a dedicated script cache ("___scriptcache")
so that they can be easily created/modified using the standard cache
operations (put/get/etc.).

Here's an example of a very simple script:


The script above just obtains the default cache, retrieves the value
with key 'a' and returns it (the Javascript script engine uses the last
evaluated expression of a script as its return value).
The first line of the script is special: it looks like a comment, but,
like the first line in Unix shell scripts, it actually provides
instructions on how the script should be run in the form of
properties.

The mode property instructs the execution engine where we want to run
the script: _local_ for running the script on the node that is handling
the request and _distributed_ for running the script wrapped by a
distributed executor. Bear in mind that you can certainly use clustered
operations in _local_ mode.

Scripts can also take named parameters which will "appear" as bindings
in the execution scope.


Invoking it from a Java HotRod client would look like this:


Server-side scripts will be evolving quite a bit in Infinispan 8.1 where
we will add support for the broader concept of server-side tasks which
will include both scripts and deployable code which can be invoked in
the same way, all managed and configured by the upcoming changes in the
Infinispan Server console.
