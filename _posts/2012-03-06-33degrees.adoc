In addition to my currently ongoing
http://infinispan.blogspot.com/2012/03/presentation-from-hell-when-nothing.html[tour
of user groups in North America], I will be presenting on Infinispan at
http://2012.33degree.org/[33Degrees] in Krakow, Poland. In addition to
my talking on data grids, I will also run a NoSQL BOF at 33 degrees so
if you have an interest in NoSQL, big data, analytics, search or, well,
storage in general, and will be at 33Degrees, do come by. :)

 Cheers Manik
