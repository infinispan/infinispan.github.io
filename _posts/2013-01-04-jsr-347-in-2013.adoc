Happy new year, everyone.

One of my goals for 2013 is to push JSR 347 into action again.  To kick
start this, I propose a meeting among expert group members - anyone else
with an interest in the JSR is welcome to attend as well.

Details are in
https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/jsr347/OBXiCrIWvsM[my
post] to the mailing list.  Please respond to the mail list if you are
interested in participating.

Cheers
Manik
