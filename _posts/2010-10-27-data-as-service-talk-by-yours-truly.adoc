Last month, at
the http://www.oracle.com/us/javaonedevelop/index.html[JavaOne] conference
in San Francisco, I spoke about data grids.  A
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birds_of_a_Feather_(computing)[BOF] session
on on cloud-ready data stores using data grids, and a conference session
on measuring performance and benchmarking data grids.  But in addition
to the official JavaOne talks, I also did two short, 20-minute
mini-sessions at the http://www.redhat.com/[Red Hat] booth at the
JavaOne pavillion, titled _Data-as-a-Service using Infinispan_.  The
good folks at the Red Hat booth even recorded it and put it online on
Vimeo, where it is accessible on-demand.
