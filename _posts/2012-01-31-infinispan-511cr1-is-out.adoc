Thanks to everyone that downloaded Infinispan 5.1.0.FINAL 'Brahma' in
the last week. We've had tremendous feedback from the community and as a
result we've decided to do a minor release called 5.1.1.CR1 to
https://issues.jboss.org/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?projectId=12310799&version=12318959[address
the most important issues reported]. So, if you're using
5.1.0.FINAL, I'd strongly recommend that you upgrade as soon as
possible. We hope to do a FINAL release later on this week.

Please keep
the http://community.jboss.org/en/infinispan?view=discussions[feedback] coming,
and as always, you can download the release
from http://www.jboss.org/infinispan/downloads[here].

Cheers,
Galder
