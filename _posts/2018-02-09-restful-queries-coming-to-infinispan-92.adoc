One of the interesting features in the upcoming Infinispan 9.2 release
is the possibility to execute queries over the REST endpoint, enabling
users to take advantage of the easy-to-use and expressiveness of the
Ickle query language, that combines a subset of JP-QL with full-text
features. You can learn more info about Ickle in a
http://blog.infinispan.org/2016/12/meet-ickle.html[previous post].

Besides exposing query over REST, Infinispan 9.2 also adds support for
mapping between JSON and Protobuf formats, allowing an efficient storage
in binary format while exposing queries, reading and writing content as
JSON documents.

To illustrate those new capabilities, this post will walk you through a
sample app from scratch!


=== Sample app

===== Running the server

We start by
https://github.com/jboss-dockerfiles/infinispan/tree/master/server[running]
the Infinispan Server 9.2.0.CR2 (the latest release candidate):



This will get you a fresh instance of Infinispan running, with login and
password 'user' and the REST port 8080 mapped to localhost. TIP: if you
run more than one container, they'll form a cluster automatically.


===== Creating an indexed cache

Next step is to create an indexed cache called 'pokemon'. We make use of
the CLI  (Command Line Interface) to create this cache. In the future,
with https://issues.jboss.org/browse/ISPN-8529[ISPN-8529], we'll also be
able to create cache with arbitrary configuration using REST, but for
now we execute a CLI recipe:




===== Creating the schema

In order to be able to query, we need to define a protobuf schema for
our data. The schema follows the Protobuf 2 format (Protobuf 3 support
is coming) and allows for extensions to define indexing properties
(analyzers, storage, etc).

Here's how it looks like:



The protobuf schema can contain some comments on top of fields and
messages with "annotations" to control indexing. Hibernate Search users
will recognize some of those pseudo annotations we are using here: they
resemble closely their counterpart.



===== Registering the schema

Once we have our schema, we can easily register it via REST:




===== Populating the cache

We're now ready to put some data in the cache. As mentioned earlier,
ingesting can be done by sending JSON documents directly. Once
Infinispan receives those documents, it will convert them to protobuf,
index and store them.

In order to match a particular inbound document to an entity in the
schema, Infinispan uses a special meta field called *__type_* that must
be provided in the document. Here's an example of a JSON document that
conforms to our schema:


Writing the document is easy:



we can retrieve content by key as JSON:




===== Querying


The new query endpoint can be called with an "action" parameter named
"search", after the cache name. The simplest query, which returns all
data can be done with:

http://localhost:8080/rest/pokemon?action=search&query=from%20Pokemon[http://localhost:8080/rest/pokemon?action=search&query=from
Pokemon]


If you do not want to return all the fields, use a _Select_ clause:

http://localhost:8080/rest/pokemon?action=search&query=Select%20name,%20speed%20from%20Pokemon[http://localhost:8080/rest/pokemon?action=search&query=Select
name, speed from Pokemon]


Pagination can be controlled with the _offset_, _max_results_ URL
parameters:

http://localhost:8080/rest/pokemon?action=search&query=from%20Pokemon&offset=2&max_results=20[http://localhost:8080/rest/pokemon?action=search&query=from
Pokemon&offset=2&max_results=20]


Grouping is also possible:

http://localhost:8080/rest/pokemon?action=search&query=select%20count(p.name)%20from%20Pokemon%20p%20group%20by%20generation[http://localhost:8080/rest/pokemon?action=search&query=select
count(p.name) from Pokemon p group by generation]


Example of a query result:

http://localhost:8080/rest/pokemon?action=search&query=select%20name,pokedex_number,against_fire%20from%20Pokemon%20order%20by%20against_fire%20asc&max_results=5[http://localhost:8080/rest/pokemon?action=search&query=select
name,pokedex_number,against_fire from Pokemon order by against_fire
asc&max_results=5]

Results:






=== Conclusion

===  

Infinispan 9.2 makes it easier to quickly ingest and query datasets
using the ubiquitous JSON format, without sacrificing type safety and
storage size.

By storing Protobuf, this will also enable other clients like the Hot
Rod C#/C++ clients to query, read and write data simultaneously with
REST clients.

The full source code for the demo, along with instructions on how to
populate the whole dataset can be found at
https://github.com/infinispan-demos/infinispan-pokemon[Github].

Finally, please try out this new feature in your own dataset and let us
know how it goes!
