We have 2 new releases to announce today:

*9.3.1.Final* includes some important bug fixes, and we recommend all
users of 9.3.0.Final to upgrade:

* Fix for CVE-2018-1131 that allows unchecked deserialization in the
server from binary java , XML and JSON payloads
* Fixed transcoding from JSON/XML to java objects with deployed entities
(https://issues.jboss.org/browse/ISPN-9336[ISPN-9336])
* Look up key in cache loader if the entry has expired but hasn't yet
been removed from the data container
(https://issues.jboss.org/browse/ISPN-9370[ISPN-9370])
* Avoid circular references in exceptions, as they were causing stack
overflows with logback 1.2.x
(https://issues.jboss.org/browse/ISPN-9362[ISPN-9362])

See the full list of bug fixes
https://issues.jboss.org/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?projectId=12310799&version=12338251[here].


*9.4.0.Alpha1* its the first iteration towards our next big release.
Highlights include:

* The Spring Cache provider now supports two configuration properties
with which you can determine how long to wait for read and write
operations respectively
(https://issues.jboss.org/browse/ISPN-9301[ISPN-9301]).
* You can now obtain nanosecond-resolution statistics for average
read/write/remove time
(https://issues.jboss.org/browse/ISPN-9352[ISPN-9352]).
* Queries now throw an AvailabilityException if the cache is in degraded
mode and partition mode isn’t ALLOW_READ_WRITES
([https://issues.jboss.org/browse/ISPN-9340[ISPN-9340])
* Admin Console: You can now delete cache from Administration console
(https://issues.jboss.org/browse/ISPN-7291[ISPN-7291]).
* Following up on the segmented data container in 9.3.0.Final, cache
stores can now be segmented as well, allowing for better performance for
bulk operations (ie. cache.size(), cache.entrySet().stream())
* The server-side Hot Rod parser is now generated automatically
(https://issues.jboss.org/browse/ISPN-8981[ISPN-8981])
