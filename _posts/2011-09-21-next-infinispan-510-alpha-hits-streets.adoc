Infinispan 5.1.0.ALPHA2 _"Brahma"_ is out now containing a consolidated
push-based approach for both state transfer in replicated caches and
rehashing in distributed ones. The new changes don't have great impact
on the distributed cache users, but for those that relied on state
transfer, it's definitely good news :). State transfer now works in such
way that when a node joins, all nodes in the cluster push state to it,
rather than the new node getting it from the cluster coordinator. As a
result of this, the task of providing the state is paralellized,
reducing the load on state providers.

On top of that, this Infinispan release is the first one to integrate
JGroups 3.0 which brings plenty of API changes that simplifies a lot of
the Infinispan/JGroups interaction. If you want to find out more about
the new JGroups version, make sure you check
