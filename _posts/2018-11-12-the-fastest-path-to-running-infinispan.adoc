Creating an Infinispan Server cluster in OpenShift has never been
easier! We've just given the OpenShift templates for Infinispan server
their biggest makeover yet which should help both Infinispan and
OpenShift users:

The
https://github.com/infinispan/infinispan-openshift-templates[repository]
has been simplified and flattened out to only leave essential
information. https://www.okd.io/minishift/[Minishift] is the preferred
way to get started with Infinispan and OpenShift, so we've tailored the
instructions for this set up.

OpenShift templates are now
https://github.com/infinispan/infinispan-openshift-templates/blob/master/infinispan-ephemeral.yaml[YAML
based] which is less verbose, but more importantly, allows Infinispan
Server XML configuration to be shown as-is. This makes it easier to
directly modify the XML in the template itself.

The fastest way to get started with Infinispan and OpenShift is to
simply fire up Minishift, set a profile, checkout our Infinipan
OpenShift
https://github.com/infinispan/infinispan-openshift-templates[repository]
and then call:

oc create -f infinispan-ephemeral.yaml
oc new-app infinispan-ephemeral

These two simple steps will get you a single node Infinispan Server
running! A more detailed getting started guide can be found in the
repository's
https://github.com/infinispan/infinispan-openshift-templates/blob/master/README.asciidoc[README]
file.

Go and try it out and let us know what you think. You can find us on
this https://infinispan.zulipchat.com/[Zulip chat]Â :)

Cheers,
