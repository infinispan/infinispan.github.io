= Infinispan Insights: Supporting Redis JSON and Scripting features with Infinispan

In Infinispan 15, we added a variety of commands to help replace your Redis server without changing your code. The 15.2 release also included Lua Scripting and Redis JSON APIs.
Key takeaways:

* Understanding Redis JSON commands
* The benefits of Lua scripting
* How and why transition applications from Redis to Infinispan, or use Infinispan as a
backend while working with Redis clients.

This article follows up on supporting multiple Redis databases with Infinispan.
For more details, check out the https://infinispan.org/blog/2024/10/07/cache-aliases-redis-databases[full article].

== Redis drop-in replacement with Infinispan
A drop-in replacement means you can substitute one technology for another without changing
application code. This is valuable because:

* *Minimizes migration effort*: You avoid rewriting logic or changing client libraries significantly.
* *Reduces downtime and risk:* You can swap the backend and test incrementally.
* *Retains existing usage patterns*: Developers can continue using the familiar APIs and data models.

Replacing open-source Redis with Infinispan offers several key benefits, especially
for Java-based or enterprise-grade systems. Infinispan is fully open source under Apache 2.0,
avoiding the licensing limitations of Redis modules. It provides advanced clustering, built-in high availability
(Active-Active cross site replication), and better support for distributed and geo-replicated setups.
It supports multiple databases even in clustered mode and it offers flexible persistence options like write-through and write-behind.
Additionally, it includes robust security features such as fine-grained access control and encryption,
and supports multiple deployment modes including embedded, server, and Kubernetes-native.

Let's test how this works, now also with JSON commands and Lua scripts.

=== Running Infinispan as usual

https://infinispan.org/get-started/[Get started tutorial] is the best place to start.
Just run the following command with docker or podman.

[source, bash]
----
podman/docker run -it -p 11222:11222 -e USER="admin" -e PASS="password" quay.io/infinispan/server:latest
----

==== Running Infinispan with the Redis default port
For those want to keep using the *6379* port, run Infinispan providing the following configuration
file:
[source, bash]
----
podman/docker run -it -p 6379:6379 -p 11222:11222 -e USER="admin" -e PASS="password" quay.io/infinispan/server:latest -c infinispan-resp.xml
----
* Map -p 6379:6379 -p 11222:11222 (you keep the access to the console)
* Provide -c infinispan-resp.xml configuration file
* -e USER="admin" -e PASS="password will be used for 11222 port security

=== Using a Redis client
Once the server is running, connect to Infinispan using Redis-CLI.
Use port *11222* instead of the default *6379* if you are running Infinispan as usual.
Since Infinispan is secured by default, make sure to provide the admin credentials.

[source, bash]
----
> redis-cli -3 -p 11222 --raw
127.0.0.1:11222> AUTH admin password
OK
----
* Connect using Protocol 3
* Use -p 11222 (Infinispan single port)
* Add --raw option to allow formatting
* Authenticate with admin/password

You can access the Infinispan Server Console as usual in http://localhost:11222, with admin/password credentials.
Check the (https://infinispan.org/blog/2024/10/07/cache-aliases-redis-databases[cache aliases tutorial] to learn
more about respCache and how it connects to Redis Databases and cache aliases.

== Redis JSON Feature
RedisJSON is a powerful extension for managing JSON data directly in Redis.
If you're working with JSON-like data and need fast, efficient access and
manipulation, RedisJSON is a great tool to use. This is part of the RedisStack
or Redis Enterprise, and works with the JSON Query engine
(which is not supported by Infinispan for now).

[source, bash]
----
127.0.0.1:11222> JSON.SET doc $ '{"project":"infinispan", "details": {"latest": "16.0", "year": 2025}}'
OK
127.0.0.1:11222> JSON.GET doc INDENT "\t" NEWLINE "\n" SPACE " " $
[
	{
		"project": "infinispan",
		"details": {
			"latest": "16.0",
			"year": 2025
		}
	}
]
127.0.0.1:11222> JSON.OBJKEYS doc $
project
details
----

In the console, the REST API currently shows the key, and the value is
only displayed as the JSON.Bucket. Additional support for displaying more data
is planned for future Infinispan releases, so we just need to wait a bit for the ability to
show more content through the REST API.

*All JSON commands are implemented for the RESP 3 responses.*

== Scripting Feature
Lua scripting in Redis lets you write small programs in the Lua language
that run directly on the Redis server. This helps you perform multiple actions
in one go, saving time and making things faster. You can use it to do complex
tasks without sending many commands back and forth between the client and server.

Since *Infinispan 16.0*, you can now use Lua Scripting to perform these operations.

[source, bash]
----
127.0.0.1:11222> EVAL "return 'Hello, scripting!'" 0
Hello, scripting!
127.0.0.1:11222> EVAL "return ARGV[1]" 0 Hello
Hello
127.0.0.1:11222> EVAL "return ARGV[1]" 0 Parameterization!
Parameterization!
127.0.0.1:11222> EVAL "redis.call('SET', KEYS[1], ARGV[1]) redis.call('SET', KEYS[2], ARGV[2]) redis.call('SET', KEYS[3], ARGV[3]) return 'SET commands executed'" 3 key1 key2 key3 value1 value2 value3
SET commands executed
127.0.0.1:11222> KEYS "*"
key2
key3
key1

----

Technically speaking, when using Infinispan, scripts are stored in an internal
cache *___script_cache*.
This cache is handled by Infinispan and manipulating it requires admin permissions.

== Conclusions
In this tutorial, you’ve learned how to use Infinispan for JSON commands and Scripting from
version 16.0. Redis Hot Replacement is gaining attention,
especially with the concerns about Redis' licensing changes in 2024.
Infinispan, an open-source solution under the Apache 2.0 license,
is part of the https://www.commonhaus.org/[Commonhaus foundation], allowing
free use in your products.
If you need official support, you can get it through supported versions of Infinispan.
