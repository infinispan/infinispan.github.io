The implementation of cache authorization in Infinispan has
traditionally followed the JAAS model of wrapping calls in a
PrivilegedAction invoked through Subject.doAs(). This led to the
following cumbersome pattern:



We also provided an implementation which, instead of relying on enabling
the SecurityManager, could use a lighter and faster ThreadLocal for
storing the Subject:



While this solves the performance issue, it still leads to unreadable
code.
This is why, in Infinispan 9.1 we have introduced a new way to perform
authorization on caches:



Obviously, for multiple invocations, you can hold on to the
"impersonated" cache and reuse it:


We hope this will make your life simpler and your code more readable !
