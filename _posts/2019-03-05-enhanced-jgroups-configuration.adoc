Infinispan uses http://www.jgroups.org/[JGroups] as its underlying
clustering layer. In order to configure the finer details of clustering
(discovery, flow control, cross-site, etc) you have to provide a
separate XML file with the desired configuration and reference it from
your Infinispan XML file as follows:



For simple configurations this is usually fine, but configuring complex
setups, such as cross-site replication, means juggling multiple files
(one for the local stack, one for the cross-site stack and one for the
relay configuration).

Starting with Infinispan 10 Alpha2 we have introduced a number of
changes to make your life with JGroups configurations a lot easier.


== Default stacks

Infinispan now comes with two pre-declared stacks: `tcp` and `udp`.
Using them is as simple as just referencing their names in the
`<transport>` element.


== Inline stacks

Inlining a stack means you can put the JGroups configuration inside the
Infinispan one as follows:


You can use the full JGroups schema, and by using XML namespaces you get
full validation.

== Stack inheritance

Most of the time you want to reuse one of the pre-declared stacks but
just override some of the parameters (e.g. discovery) to suit your
environment. The following example creates a new `tcpgossip` stack which
is based on the default tcp stack but replaces the discovery protocol
with `TCPGOSSIP`:



In the above example you can see that we have enhanced the JGroups
protocol declarations with two new attributes: `ispn:stack.combine` and
`ispn:stack.position` which affect how and where protocol changes are
applied on the parent configuration to obtain a new configuration.
`stack.combine` can be one of `COMBINE` (the default, possibly
overriding any specified attributes), `REPLACE` (which completely
replaces the protocol and resets all attributes), `REMOVE` (removes the
protocol) and `INSERT_AFTER` (which places this protocol in the stack
immediately after the protocol specified by `stack.position`).

== Multiple stacks and Cross-site

The inline configuration really shows its usefulness in cross-site
configurations. In fact, the JGroups stack declaration has been extended
with a special element which replaces the need for a separate relay XML
file and can reference other stacks just by name. The following
configuration uses the default `udp` stack for the local cluster
transport and uses the default `tcp` stack for connecting to a remote
site:


Having the entire configuration in a single place greatly simplifies
management. Of course you can combine all of the above features to
obtain the configuration you need for your environment. You can find
more details and examples in the
http://infinispan.org/docs/dev/user_guide/user_guide.html#cache_configuration_clustered[documentation].
Enjoy !
