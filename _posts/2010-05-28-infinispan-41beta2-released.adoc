Hi,

The second and hopefully last Beta for 4.1 has just been released.
Thanks to excellent community feedback, several HotRod client/server
issues were fixed. Besides this and other bug-fixes (check
https://jira.jboss.org/secure/IssueNavigator.jspa?mode=hide&requestId=12313283[this]
for complete list), following new features were added:
- an http://community.jboss.org/wiki/Keyaffinityservice[key affinity
service] that generates keys to be distributed to specific nodes
-
http://docs.jboss.org/infinispan/4.1/apidocs/org/infinispan/loaders/remote/RemoteCacheStore.html[RemoteCacheStore]
that allow an Infinspan cluster to be used as an remote data store

Enjoy!
Mircea
