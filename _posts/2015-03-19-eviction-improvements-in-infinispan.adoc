As many of you are most likely aware Infinispan provides a way to limit
how many entries are stored in a single node's memory at a given time. 
This is configurable via the eviction element in xml or
EvictionConfiguraitonBuilder through the programmatic configuration.

In 7.2.0.Beta1 we have made some internal changes to our internal
eviction support.  This mostly entailed moving our implementation to the
new https://issues.jboss.org/browse/ISPN-3023[ConcurrentHashMap that was
updated for Java 8].  This provides for a few new benefits and
behaviors.


== Long Size Support

Previously our eviction entry amount was limited to the maximum value of
an int (2^31) and was always rounded up to the nearest power of 2 (ie.
100 would be changed to 128 which is 2^7).

With the new changes you can store up to a long worth of entries and it
is not constrained to a power of 2.  Unfortunately Beta1 does not
contain the changes to allow for a long to be configured yet, but this
should be https://issues.jboss.org/browse/ISPN-5306[fixed] before
7.2.0.Final is done.


== Memory wide eviction size

The old bounded map performed it's eviction based on evicting elements
stored in the same segment.  This could cause the map to evict entries
before it actually hit the maximum size.  This is described in detail
http://infinispan.org/docs/7.1.x/faqs/faqs.html#_cache_s_number_of_entries_never_reaches_configured_maxentries_why_is_that[here].

The new ConcurrentHashMap for Java 8 automatically resizes its number of
segments.  As such the old method of eviction will not work.  Instead we
keep track of all entries in the entire map and only evict when we go
over the max size.  This prevents entries from being evicted that may
not be the the least recent (previously in the case of when many
elements in the same segment were added).


== Better scalability

Since we utilize the new ConcurrentHashMap this automatically resizes
the segments based on the amount of entries in the cache.  Increasing
the number of segments has some various benefits.

=== *Less blocking*

With more segments, that means there is more fine grained locking when
updating an entry.  The determination whether an entry needs evicting is
done outside of any lock, further reducing contention.

=== Lower time complexity

Since there are more segments there should be fewer hash collisions,
which should provide O(1) complexity much more frequently for accessing
a given key.

Cheers,
