The existing CacheLoader/CacheStore API has been around since Infinispan
4.0. In this release of Infinispan we've taken a major step forward in
both simplifying the integration with persistence and opening the door
for some pretty significant performance improvements.


== What's new



So here's what the new persistence integration brings to the table:

* alignment with http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=107[JSR-107]: now we
have a
http://docs.jboss.org/infinispan/6.0/apidocs/org/infinispan/persistence/spi/CacheWriter.html[CacheWriter]
and
http://docs.jboss.org/infinispan/6.0/apidocs/org/infinispan/persistence/spi/CacheLoader.html[CacheLoader]
interface similar to the the
https://github.com/jsr107/jsr107spec/blob/master/src/main/java/javax/cache/integration/CacheLoader.java[loader]
and
https://github.com/jsr107/jsr107spec/blob/master/src/main/java/javax/cache/integration/CacheWriter.java[writer]
in JSR 107, which should considerably help writing portable stores
across JCache compliant vendors
* simplified transaction integration: all the locking is now handled
within the Infinispan layer, so implementors don't have to be concerned
coordinating concurrent access to the store (old
http://docs.jboss.org/infinispan/4.1/apidocs/org/infinispan/loaders/LockSupportCacheStore.html[LockSupportCacheStore]
is dropped for that reason).
* parallel iteration: it is now possible to iterate over entries in the
store with multiple threads in parallel. Map/Reduce tasks immediately
benefit from this, as the map/reduce  tasks now run in parallel over
both the nodes in the cluster and within the same node (multiple
threads)
* https://issues.jboss.org/browse/ISPN-3512[reduced serialization]
(translated in less CPU usage): the new API allows exposing the stored
entries in serialized format. If an entry is fetched from persistent
storage for the sole purpose of being sent remotely, we no longer need
to deserialize it (when reading from the store) and serialize it back
(when writing to the wire). Now we can write to the wire the serialized
format as read fro the storage directly

== API



Now let's take a look at the API in more detail:

http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-aqX4MDbuzy4/Ujbq-om6YsI/AAAAAAAAMkQ/taQggrqe7Kc/s1600/new_loader_API.png[image:http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-aqX4MDbuzy4/Ujbq-om6YsI/AAAAAAAAMkQ/taQggrqe7Kc/s320/new_loader_API.png[image,width=320,height=305]]





  The diagram above shows the main classes in the API:

* http://docs.jboss.org/infinispan/6.0/apidocs/org/infinispan/commons/io/ByteBuffer.html[ByteBuffer]
- abstracts the serialized form on an object
* http://docs.jboss.org/infinispan/6.0/apidocs/org/infinispan/persistence/spi/MarshalledEntry.html[MarshalledEntry] -
abstracts the information held within a persistent store corresponding
to a key-value added to the cache. Provides method for reading this
information both in serialized
(http://docs.jboss.org/infinispan/6.0/apidocs/org/infinispan/commons/io/ByteBuffer.html[ByteBuffer])
and deserialized (Object) format. Normally data read from the store is
kept in serialized format and lazily deserialized on demand, within
the http://docs.jboss.org/infinispan/6.0/apidocs/org/infinispan/persistence/spi/MarshalledEntry.html[MarshalledEntry] implementation
*  http://docs.jboss.org/infinispan/6.0/apidocs/org/infinispan/persistence/spi/CacheWriter.html[CacheWriter] and http://docs.jboss.org/infinispan/6.0/apidocs/org/infinispan/persistence/spi/CacheLoader.html[CacheLoader] 
provide basic methods for reading and writing to a store
* http://docs.jboss.org/infinispan/6.0/apidocs/org/infinispan/persistence/spi/AdvancedCacheLoader.html[AdvancedCacheLoader]
and
http://docs.jboss.org/infinispan/6.0/apidocs/org/infinispan/persistence/spi/AdvancedCacheWriter.html[AdvancedCacheWriter] provide
operations to manipulate the underlaying storage in bulk: parallel
iteration and purging of expired entries, clear and size. 

A provider might choose to only implement a subset of these interfaces:

* Not implementing
the  http://docs.jboss.org/infinispan/6.0/apidocs/org/infinispan/persistence/spi/AdvancedCacheWriter.html[AdvancedCacheWriter] makes
the given writer not usable for purging expired entries or clear
* Not implementing
 the http://docs.jboss.org/infinispan/6.0/apidocs/org/infinispan/persistence/spi/AdvancedCacheLoader.html[AdvancedCacheLoader] makes
the information stored in the given loader not used for preloading, nor
for the map/reduce iteration

If you're looking at migrating your existing store to the new API,
looking at the
https://github.com/infinispan/infinispan/blob/master/core/src/main/java/org/infinispan/persistence/file/SingleFileStore.java[SingleFileStore] 
for inspiration can be of great help.



==== Configuration



And finally, the way the stores are configured has changed:

* the 5.x _loaders_ element is now replaced with _persistence_
* both the loaders and writers are configured through a unique _store_
element  (vs _loader_ and  _store_, as allowed in 5.x)
* the _preload_ and _shared_ attributes are configured at each
individual store, giving more flexibility when it comes to configuring
multiple chained stores 

Cheers,

Mircea
