Hi,

Cross datacenter replication has been for a while one of the most
requested features in Infinispan. In order to support this as good as
possible we are looking for as many use cases that require this
functionality. So if you've ever came to this problem or you think you
will, or you simply feel like brainstorming about an interesting
failover situation please add your comments
https://community.jboss.org/wiki/CrossDatacenterReplication-Design[here].

Thank you,
Mircea
