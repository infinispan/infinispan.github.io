@ Infinispan we've been extremely busy over the summer
http://www.dzone.com/links/infinispan_410final_released.html[baking
Infinispan 4.1.0.FINAL and after releasing it just over a couple of
weeks ago], it's time to go out and tell the world about it!

As far as I'm concerned, I'll be at the http://jaoo.dk/[JAOO] conference
in Aarhus, Denmark, where I'll be speaking about the
http://jaoo.dk/aarhus-2010/presentation/Beyond%20peer-to-peer%20data%20grids%20with%20Infinispan%20Servers[importance
of the brand new Infinispan Server modules], emphasizing the motivation
for developing them and showcasing some really exciting use cases.

Just a few days later I'll be in
http://jboss.org/events/JUDCon/JUDCon2010Berlin.html[Berlin for Europe's
round for hosting JBoss' JUDCon], a developer conference by developers
where I'll be introducing a
http://jboss.org/events/JUDCon/JUDCon2010Berlin/agenda.html#1100AM[brand-new,
innovative data eviction algorithm included in Infinispan 4.1], which
increases eviction precision and reduces overhead. I will also be
talking about
http://jboss.org/events/JUDCon/JUDCon2010Berlin/agenda.html#1000AM[the
Infinispan Server modules] in this conference. On top of that, Mircea
Markus will be explaining
http://jboss.org/events/JUDCon/JUDCon2010Berlin/agenda.html#100PM[how
transactions are handled within Infinispan] and how to do
http://jboss.org/events/JUDCon/JUDCon2010Berlin/agenda.html#100PM[continuous
querying of Infinispan data grids]. In total, Infinispan has 4 talks @
JUDCon which is very exciting for us!!

To round things up, on the 14th of October I'll be in Lausanne where
I'll be http://www.jugevents.org/jugevents/event/29833[introducing the
audience of the local JUG to Infinispan], talking about our motivations
to create Infinispan, how different it is to JBoss Cache...etc.

So, if you happen to be around, make sure you come! It'll be fun :)
