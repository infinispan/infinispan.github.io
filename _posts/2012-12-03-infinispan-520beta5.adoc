Hi Infinispan users,

5.2.0.Beta5 contains the usual batch of fixes especially around
Non-Blocking state transfer functionality, Map Reduce and the CLI.

Functionality-wise, it is now possible to read/write data concurrently
to the same remote cache both via a RemoteCacheManager and a
RemoteCacheStore by enabling "rawValues" in the latter. This is the
final item that was needed to enable us to implement
https://community.jboss.org/wiki/RollingUpgradesInInfinispan[Rolling
Upgrades] for remote caches. Because of this feature the HotRod protocol
required a couple of extensions and therefore its version has been
bumped to
https://docs.jboss.org/author/display/ISPN/Hot+Rod+Protocol+-+Version+1.2[1.2]

For a detailed list of all the issues fixed please refer the
https://issues.jboss.org/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?projectId=12310799&version=12320689[release
notes].

distribution or
