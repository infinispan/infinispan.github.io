So I finally get to recap on http://www.jboss.org/events/JUDCon[JUDCon]
in Boston and http://www.redhat.com/summit/[JBoss World/Red Hat Summit]
from last week.  And wow what a week it was too; I work with some
brilliant minds.  Massively inspiring and innovative people.

JUDCon started well, at the World Trade Centre in Boston.  With over 200
people attending, it was the largest JUDCon we've ever done, with three
parallel tracks of some of the coolest tech, many by non-Red Hat
employees.  With regards to Infinispan, Mircea did a
http://www.jboss.org/events/JUDCon/day2track2.html#930AM[deep-dive] covering
how Infinispan works "under the hood".  Sanne did a talk on
http://www.jboss.org/events/JUDCon/day2track2.html#230PM[advanced
querying across a data grid], including making use of map/reduce
techniques.  I delivered a talk specifically on
http://www.slideshare.net/maniksurtani/mapreduce-in-the-cloud-infinispan-distributed-task-execution-framework[map/reduce
and distributed code execution] across Infinispan nodes - a talk I
delivered on behalf of Vladimir as he sadly couldn't make the event due
to personal reasons.  The first day ended in a pizza-and-beer-fuelled
hackathon that went on till 2am.  Hopefully this will give you an idea
of what JUDCon is all about, including the quality and focus of talks,
and whet your appetite - make you want to attend the next such event.
 :-)  Trust me, for techies, there's no better way of immersing yourself
in it.

And then there was JBoss World.  As many in the industry keeps saying,
JBoss has got its mojo back.  Coolness reminiscent of Marc Fleury's
early
http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/06_15/b3979098.htm[bad-boy
JBoss] - a poke in the eye of establishment, disruptive and brazen,
JBoss has gone back to its roots.  Craig Muzilla talked numbers and new
products, Mark Little talked about his vision of ubiquitous computing
and http://community.jboss.org/blogs/mark.little/2011/05/08/jboss-everywhere[JBoss
Everywhere], and then the much tweeted, much talked-about demo started.
 Many said we were nuts to try and pull off a live demo of such scale
and complexity - let me put it this way, we had no backup.  :-) I'm not
going to spoil the demo for you, a recording of the keynote including
the demo is http://vimeo.com/24798138[here] (the demo starts 39 minutes
into the video).

Demos aside, JBoss World/Summit was an excellent event.  The biggest of
its kind to date, I presented on
http://www.redhat.com/summit/2011/presentations/jbossworld/decoding_the_code/wednesday/surtani_w_1400_Highly_Scalable_Data_Grids_and_Distributed_Caching_with_Infinispan.pdf[use
cases and design patterns] involving Infinispan, Bela spoke about
http://www.redhat.com/summit/highlights/[geographic failover] (click on
the JBoss World tab for the video).  Sanne and Emmanuel talked about
http://www.redhat.com/summit/2011/presentations/jbossworld/whats_new/wednesday/bernard_w_420_jpa_in_hibernate.pdf[Hibernate
OGM], the ultra-cool JPA layer over Infinispan that so many people want
to get their hands on.  Craig Bomba from http://www.cboe.com/[CBOE] -
the largest options exchange in the world - talked about going live with
Infinispan, stressing on keeping close to the community, participating
and being "good open source citizens".  Something we all applaud.

But for many folks, the biggest thing was the announcement of the
http://www.jboss.com/edg6-early-access[JBoss Enterprise Data Grid
platform].  A fully supported data grid, based on Infinispan.  This
enables users to buy production support, consultancy and training around
Infinispan.  The announcement even made its way to the
http://online.wsj.com/article/PR-CO-20110503-906624.html[Wall Street
Journal], among many other illustrious publications!

So now with all the adrenalin - and
http://cocktails.about.com/od/atozcocktailrecipes/r/old_fshned_cktl.htm[old-fashioneds]
at our favourite bar, http://www.yelp.com/biz/drink-boston-2[Drink] - of
last week behind me, it's time to focus on getting Infinispan 5.0 into a
stable state and cutting what will be the fastest, most feature-rich and
ultimately usable Infinispan release ever.  Watch this space.

Cheers
Manik
