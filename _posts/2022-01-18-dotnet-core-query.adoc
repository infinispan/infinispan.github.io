Dear Infinispanners and .NET Core lovers,

Time has passed, keys have been pressed and features have been implemented since
we https://infinispan.org/blog/2021/06/21/infinispan-dotnet-core-client[presented],
some months ago, the new .NET core client project.

To show the progresses done on the project we decided to write a demo/tutorial on
how you can run remote queries against Infinispan Server deployments in your .NET Core application.

The demo aims to prove the overall maturity of the client and highlight some key client features like:

* it's shipped as a nuget package, so it can be easily included in a C# project;
* it's based on non blocking core, thus it has a native support for concurrency;
* it supports language neutral data types with Protobuf definition.

Want to know more go to the https://github.com/infinispan/Infinispan.Hotrod.Core/tree/query-demo[demo page] and try it!

We hope this is a good 2022 start for the all Infinispan C# developers!

Please let us know your thoughts, a good place for them is the https://github.com/infinispan/Infinispan.Hotrod.Core/issues[issues] page.
