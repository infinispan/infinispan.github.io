Dear Infinispan users,

it has been a while since our last release and quite a few things have
been cooking in the Infinispan furnace. Bear in mind that the list below
should just serve as a summary and that dedicated blogs, documentation
and examples will appear in the near future.


== Server

Since 5.3, our server has been built on top of WildFly (JBoss AS7 at the
time). WildFly gave us a very solid base, including integration with a
lot of useful components (security, datasources, management etc) but it
also forced us to maintain a large amount of integration code. We have
therefore decided to start from a much leaner base to build the new
server which, internally we've been calling ServerNG, but which we're
now releasing as "Infinispan Server". The old WildFly-based server is
still available, but it should be considered "legacy" and will no longer
receive any feature enhancements.

The new server deserves its own dedicated post, but its main features
are:

* smaller size (36MB vs 130MB)
* smaller memory footprint (20MB heap usage at boot vs 40MB)
* single-port: the Hot Rod, REST and management endpoint are now served
through a single-port (11222) with automatic protocol detection between
HTTP/1.1, HTTP/2 and Hot Rod. The memcached endpoint is handled
separately since we don't implement the binary protocol yet.
* security implemented using
https://docs.jboss.org/author/display/WFLY/WildFly+Elytron+Security[WildFly
Elytron] currently supporting PLAIN, DIGEST-MD5, SCRAM, EXTERNAL mechs
for Hot Rod, BASIC, DIGEST, CLIENT_CERT for REST/HTTP
(OAuth/JWT/GS2/GSSAPI/SPNEGO will be coming in the next releases)
* the server configuration extends the embedded configuration scheme
* caches/counters are created and managed dynamically through Hot Rod /
REST.

== Marshalling

Infinispan's marshalling has received a significant overhaul and it is
now split into three distinct marshallers: Internal, Persistence and
User (https://issues.jboss.org/browse/ISPN-7409[ISPN-7409]
https://issues.jboss.org/browse/ISPN-9621[ISPN-9621])
The Persistence marshaller is now based on ProtoBuf allowing for
long-term compatibility of data stored in memory and in cache stores.
The Store Migrator has been updated to allow migration from Infinispan
8.x/9.x cache stores to the new format
(https://issues.jboss.org/browse/ISPN-10276[ISPN-10276])


== Core changes

Infinispan's internal dependency-injection has been completely rewritten
so that factories, components and dependencies are discovered and
resolved at compile time instead of using runtime reflection. This,
together with the marshalling changes and recent JGroups changes, paves
the way for usage and native compilation with
https://quarkus.io/[Quarkus].

== REST

The REST API is continuing its overhaul with the following additions to
the v2 API

* Cluster Resource
(https://issues.jboss.org/browse/ISPN-10268[ISPN-10268])
* Cache Resource (https://issues.jboss.org/browse/ISPN-9772[ISPN-9772]
https://issues.jboss.org/browse/ISPN-10392[ISPN-10392])
* Counter Resource
(https://issues.jboss.org/browse/ISPN-10151[ISPN-10151]
https://issues.jboss.org/browse/ISPN-10152[ISPN-10152])

The REST endpoint now fully supports authorization
(https://issues.jboss.org/browse/ISPN-8736[ISPN-8736])

== Reactive API

The first implementation of our new Reactive API have been merged. This
is still work in progress and the API will receive major changes until
the Final release.
The new API includes a new API module and a new KeyValueStore Hot Rod
client where search, continuous search and Key Value store methods are
included.

== Cross-Site Replication

Async mode cross-site replication received 2 major improvements:

* async mode is now able to detect disconnections between sites and
bring the site offline based on <take-offline> configuration
(https://issues.jboss.org/browse/ISPN-10180[ISPN-10180])
* track and exposes the average replication times for asynchronous
requests (https://issues.jboss.org/browse/ISPN-9457[ISPN-9457])



== Non-blocking



* Non-blocking Hot Rod authentication
(https://issues.jboss.org/browse/ISPN-9841[ISPN-9841])
* Non-blocking REST endpoint
(https://issues.jboss.org/browse/ISPN-10210[ISPN-10210])
* Update internal remote listener code to support non blocking
(https://issues.jboss.org/browse/ISPN-9716[ISPN-9716])
* Update internal embedded listeners to be non blocking
(https://issues.jboss.org/browse/ISPN-9715[ISPN-9715])



== Removal/deprecations

A new major release is also an opportunity to do some house cleaning.

=== Deprecations



* Deprecate GridFileSystem and org.infinispan.io stream implementations
(https://issues.jboss.org/browse/ISPN-10298[ISPN-10298])
* Deprecated Total Order transaction mode
(https://issues.jboss.org/browse/ISPN-10259[ISPN-10259])

=== Removals

* AtomicMap implementations removed
(https://issues.jboss.org/browse/ISPN-10230[ISPN-10230])
* Remove deprecated org.infinispan.io classes
(https://issues.jboss.org/browse/ISPN-10297[ISPN-10297])
* Remove org.infinispan.tools.ConfigurationConverter
(https://issues.jboss.org/browse/ISPN-10231[ISPN-10231])
* Remove compatibility mode
(https://issues.jboss.org/browse/ISPN-10370[ISPN-10370])
