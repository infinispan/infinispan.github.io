Why benchmarking?
Benchmarking is an important aspect for us: we want to monitor our
performance improvements between releases and compare ourselves with
other products as well. Benchmarking a data grid product such as
Infinispan is not a trivial task: one needs to start multiple processes
over multiple machines, coordinate between them to make sure everything
runs at once and centralize reports. Then there is the question of what
access patterns the benchmark should stress.


#*Introducing the cache benchmarking framework
(CBF)
*#What we've come up with is a tool to help us run our benchmarks and
generate reports and charts. And more:
- simple to configure (see config sample bellow)
- simple to run. We supply a set of .sh scripts that connect to remote
nodes and start cluster instances for you.
- open source. Everybody can download it, read the code and run the
benchmarks by themselves. Published results can be easily verified and
validated.
- extensible. It's easy to extend the framework in order to benchmark
against additional products. It's also easy to write different data
access patterns to be tested.

- scalable. At this moment we've used CBF for benchmarking up to 62
nodes.

- users can test products, configurations, and access patterns on _their
own hardware_ and network. This is crucial, since it means educated
decisions can be made based on _relevant_ and _use-case specific_
statistics and measurements. Further, the benchmark can even be used to
compare performance of different configurations and tuning parameters of
a single data grid product, to help users choose a configuration that
works best for them

Below is a sample configuration file and generated report.

<bench-config>

  <master bindAddress="${127.0.0.1:master.address}" port="${2103:master.port}"/>

  <benchmark initSize="2" maxSize="${4:slaves}" increment="1">
    <DestroyWrapper runOnAllSlaves="true"/>
    <StartCluster/>
    <ClusterValidation partialReplication="false"/>
    <Warmup operationCount="1000"/>
    <WebSessionBenchmark numberOfRequests="2500" numOfThreads="2"/>
    <CsvReportGeneration/>
  </benchmark>

  <products>
    <jbosscache3>
      <config name="mvcc/mvcc-repl-sync.xml"/>
    </jbosscache3>
    <infinispan4>
      <config name="repl-sync.xml"/>
      <config name="dist-sync.xml"/>
      <config name="dist-sync-l1.xml"/>
    </infinispan4>
  </products>

  <reports>
    <report name="Replicated">
      <item product="infinispan4" config="repl-sync.xml"/>
      <item product="jbosscache3" config="mvcc/mvcc-repl-sync.xml"/>
    </report>
    <report name="Distributed">
      <item product="infinispan4" config="dist-*"/>
    </report>
    <report name="All" includeAll="true"/>
  </reports>

</bench-config>

And this is what a generated charts look like:

Where can you find CBF?
CBF can be found
https://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/cachebenchfwk/wiki[here]. For a quick
way of getting up to speed with it we recommend the

minutes tutorial].

Enjoy!
