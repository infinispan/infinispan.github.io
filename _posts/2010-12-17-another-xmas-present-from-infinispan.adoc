So Christmas is meant to be full of presents, right?  Yep you heard that
right - two releases in one day  :-)  Hot on the heels of Galder's
http://infinispan.blogspot.com/2010/12/xmas-arrives-early-for-infinispan-users.html[5.0.0.ALPHA1]
release, here's the much-awaited 4.2.0.FINAL.  This is a big release.
 Although it only contains a handful of new features
- including https://issues.jboss.org/browse/ISPN-180[ISPN-180] and https://issues.jboss.org/browse/ISPN-609[ISPN-609] - it
contains a good number of stability and performance improvements over
4.1.0, a complete list of which is
https://issues.jboss.org/secure/ConfigureReport.jspa?atl_token=38226e8a5ffb7d2f71dd7ecb7ea7aac0fc443089&versions=12315303&sections=all&style=none&selectedProjectId=12310799&reportKey=org.jboss.labs.jira.plugin.release-notes-report-plugin:releasenotes&Next=Next[available
here].  Yes, that is over 75 bugs fixed since 4.1.0!!

This really is thanks to the community, who have worked extremely hard
on testing, benchmarking and pushing 4.1.0  - and subsequent betas and
release candidates of 4.2 - which has got us here.  This really is
helping the project to mature very, very fast.  And of course the core
Infinispan dev team who've pulled some incredible feats to get this
release to completion.  You know who you are.  :-)

I'd also like to reiterate the availability of Maven Archetypes to
jump-start your Infinispan project - read all about that
http://infinispan.blogspot.com/2010/12/maven-archetypes.html[here].

So with that, I'd like to leave you with 4.2.0, _Ursus_, and say that we
are full steam ahead with 5.0 _Pagoa_ now.  :-)  As usual, download
4.2.0 http://www.jboss.org/infinispan/downloads[here], read about it
http://docs.jboss.org/infinispan/4.2/apidocs/[here], provide feedback
http://community.jboss.org/en/infinispan?view=discussions[here].

Enjoy, and Happy Holidays!
Manik
