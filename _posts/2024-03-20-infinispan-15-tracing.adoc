= Infinispan 15 tracing news

In the previous version of Infinispan https://infinispan.org/blog/2022/07/18/infinispan-14-opentelemetry-tracing[we introduced the OpenTelemetry Tracing capability].
With the new version we evolved the integration in order to:

* Allow to configure it both globally and on-cache basis using the standard Infinispan configuration.
* Trace more event types: cluster, cross-site, cache-store and security.
* Allow to select and configure, also at runtime, the span types that we want to produce and send to the collector.

The source code featured in this blog post has been taken from https://github.com/fax4ever/infinispan-demo/tree/main/infinispan-15-tracing[this demo project].

== Configure tracing

=== Global configuration

We enable tracing globally by defining a `collector-endpoint` as usual. Instead of relying on a system property,
we can now do it directly in the Infinispan Server Configuration:

[source,xml]
----
<infinispan xmlns:server="urn:infinispan:server:15.0">
   <cache-container name="default">
      <tracing collector-endpoint="http://jaeger-collector.infinispan-15-tracing.svc.cluster.local:4318" security="true" service-name="infinispan-service-tracing" />
   </cache-container>
</infinispan>
----

By default, we now support tracing using the OpenTelemetry Protocol (OTLP) with the default exporter protocol as `http/protobuf`, instead of `grpc`.
The default Jaeger port using this combination is the `4318`.

We've also activate tracing for security audits. This is a new tracing category introduced with Infinispan 15, and it's defined at the cache manager level globally.

[source,yaml]
----
infinispan:
 cacheContainer:
   tracing:
     collector-endpoint: "http://jaeger-collector.infinispan-15-tracing.svc.cluster.local:4318"
     service-name: infinispan-service-tracing
     security: true
----

=== Cache configuration

Cache scoped tracing categories must be configured in the cache configuration.
Here's an example of a cache configuration that enables tracing for additional categories:

[source,yaml]
----
replicatedCache:
  encoding:
    key:
      mediaType: "application/x-protostream"
    value:
      mediaType: "application/x-protostream"
  indexing:
    enabled: "true"
    storage: "local-heap"
    startupMode: "NONE"
    indexedEntities:
      - "fax.play.image"
  tracing:
    enabled: true
    categories:
      - "container"
      - "persistence"
      - "cluster"
      - "x-site"
----

In the example above `container`, `persistence`, `cluster` and `x-site` (cross-site replication) are enabled.
In the absence of category specification, `container` tracing is enabled by default.

==== Runtime enabling / disabling them

Furthermore, it is possible to enable / disable them or even the entire tracing at runtime.

It is possible to update enabled tracing categories at runtime and programmatically using the Infinispan HotRod client or the REST API.

The following example enables tracing for the `container` and `persistence` categories while disabling any other previously enabled categories:

[source,java]
----
Set<String> enabledCategories = Set.of("container", "persistence");
cacheManager.administration()
   .updateConfigurationAttribute(cache.getName(), "tracing.categories", String.join(",", enabledCategories));
----

== Tracing in action

Now that we have the setup. Let's see some example of tracing in action.
If we open the Jaeger console we can see immediately some security audit events logged.

At startup, only container tracing is enabled.
After some interaction, we might see a log similar to the following:

[caption="Security audit",link=/assets/images/blog/tracing-15-02-container.png]

We have the client's span and its matching container level span at the server.

Enable more span categories to gain further insights into Infinispan's internal operations.

In our demo we initially enable the persistence category at runtime. After some interactions from the client,
we can observe the internal calls that Infinispan makes to interact with the configured cache store.

Afterward, we enable (also at runtime) the cluster category. After the first interaction,
it's possible to observe the call that the Infinispan Server makes to synchronize the cluster alignment.
