Infinispan issue tracking is now on https://github.com/infinispan/infinispan/issues[GitHub issues].

We have decided to do this in order to make it easier for the community to report issues and for developers
to cross-reference them in pull requests, release notes and discussions. GitHub issues offer a streamlined interface
for https://github.com/infinispan/infinispan/issues/new?assignees=&labels=kind%2Fbug&projects=&template=bug_report.yml[reporting bugs]
and https://github.com/infinispan/infinispan/issues/new?assignees=&labels=kind%2Fenhancement&projects=&template=feature_request.yml[requesting features].

We have archived the Infinispan and ProtoStream Jira projects and have decided not to bulk import all open issues into
GitHub, as the backlog had accumulated a lot of stuff. If you had a bug report or feature request on Jira you'd like to see
fixed/implemented please report it again on GitHub, referencing the original via a link.

We hope this improvement makes it easier for everybody.
