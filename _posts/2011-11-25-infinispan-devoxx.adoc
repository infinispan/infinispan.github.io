Compared with the previous editions, this year's Devoxx was not that
different: well organised, packed with interesting presentations and
full rooms. And plenty of Belgian beer :)
Pete Muir, Sanne Grinovero and myself were also given the chance to
speak. And we did take our time with a three hours deep dive into the
Infinispan ecosystem, plenty of live demos and good discussions.
If you couldn't make it and you can't wait for the video to be published
don't worry, the demo is available online
https://docs.jboss.org/author/x/IYG_/[here]. Give it a spin and let us
know what you think!

Cheers,
Mircea
