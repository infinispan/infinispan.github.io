One of the things I've done recently was to benchmark how quickly
Infinispan starts up.  Specifically looking at LOCAL mode (where you
don't have the delays of opening sockets and discovery protocols you see
in clustered mode), I wrote up a very simple test to start up 2000
caches in a loop, using the same cache manager.

This is a pretty valid use case, since when used as a non-clustered 2nd
level cache in Hibernate, a separate cache instance is created _per
entity type_, and in the past this has become somewhat of a
bottleneck.

In this test, I compared Infinispan 5.0.1.Final, 5.1.0.CR1 and
5.1.0.CR2.  5.1.0 is significantly quicker, but I used this test (and
subsequent profiling) to commit a couple of interesting changes in
5.1.0.CR2, which has improved things even more - both in terms of CPU
performance as well as memory footprint.

Essentially, 5.1.0.CR1 made use of
https://github.com/jbossas/jandex[Jandex] to perform annotation scanning
of internal components at build-time, to prevent expensive reflection
calls to determine component dependencies and lifecycle at runtime.
 5.1.0.CR2 takes this concept a step further - now we don't just cache
annotation lookups at build-time, but entire dependency graphs.  And
determining and ordering of lifecycle methods are done at build-time
too, again making startup times significantly quicker while offering a
much tighter memory footprint.

Enough talk.  Here is
https://github.com/maniksurtani/InfinispanStartupBenchmark[the test
used], and here are the performance numbers, as per my laptop, a 2010
MacBook Pro with an i5 CPU.


Multiverse:InfinispanStartupBenchmark manik [master]$ ./bench.sh 
---- Starting benchmark ---


  Please standby ... 


Using Infinispan 5.0.1.FINAL (JMX enabled? false) 
   Created 2000 caches in *10.9 seconds* and consumed *172.32 Mb* of
memory.


Using Infinispan 5.0.1.FINAL (JMX enabled? true) 
   Created 2000 caches in *56.18 seconds* and consumed *315.21 Mb* of
memory.


Using Infinispan 5.1.0.CR1 (JMX enabled? false) 
   Created 2000 caches in *7.13 seconds* and consumed *157.5 Mb* of
memory.


Using Infinispan 5.1.0.CR1 (JMX enabled? true) 
   Created 2000 caches in *34.9 seconds* and consumed *243.33 Mb* of
memory.


Using Infinispan 5.1.0.CR2(JMX enabled? false) 
   Created 2000 caches in *3.18 seconds* and consumed *142.2 Mb* of
memory.


Using Infinispan 5.1.0.CR2(JMX enabled? true) 
   Created 2000 caches in *17.62 seconds* and consumed *176.13 Mb* of
memory.


A whopping 3.5 times faster, and significantly more memory-efficient
especially when enabling JMX reporting.  :-)


Enjoy!
