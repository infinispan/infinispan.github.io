A few days after
https://blog.infinispan.org/2018/04/danke-javaland-merci-devoxx-france.html[Devoxx
France], I headed for
http://www.developermarch.com/developersummit/[Great Indian Developer
Summit] in Bangalore where I spoke about handling streaming data on top
of a Kubernetes platform. This was a very similar talk to the one I gave
at https://www.jfokus.se/[JFokus] but with some important changes.
Together with Clement we created a small
https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava[RxJava 2] façade for Infinispan.
When combined with https://vertx.io/docs/vertx-rx/java2/[Vert.x RxJava 2
API], we could finally have an idiomatic way of handling streaming data
asynchronously and coordinating events purely using RxJava 2 APIs. This
is crucial for working with streaming data in an efficient way. On top
of that, I made some changes to push the binary data used by the demo
outside of the deployment.

Unfortunately Murphy struck during the presentation and I was unable to
run the live coding demo. A problem with Docker size image during
preparation combined with a cleanup I ran before the talk meant some of
the images had to be re-downloaded. The wireless internet connection at
the conference nor the mobile connection were good enough for me to
recover it. Once back in the hotel where I had a stable connection I was
able to record a screencast of the steps I would have followed during
the Great Indian Developer Summit talk. You can find this screencast
below:

Finally, for something slightly different, back in March I joined Ray
Tsang for a talk at https://voxxeddays.com/zurich/[Voxxed Days Zurich].
This was a really fun talk to be part of! We combined past stories of my
time at JBoss support with Ray's Kubernetes troubleshooting experience
to create an engaging talk :). You can find the video below:




The week after Sebastian Łaskawiec and I travelled to Red Hat Summit as
part of the work we did to integrate Red Hat Data Grid (Infinispan
product version) into the Scavenger Hunt game presented on the keynote
of the last day. Both Sebastian and I have been working on a blog series
which will be published very soon.

Cheers,
Galder
