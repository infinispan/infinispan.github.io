I've just returned from Jazoon where I
http://jazoon.com/Conference/Wednesday-22-June/Mircea-Markus[spoke
about] in-memory data grids/Infinispan and how can they be used to
complement or even replace databases. There was a good and enthusiastic
crowd, and the discussions ended late in the night - of course cooled
down by cold swiss beer :)

Infinispan was also present in Hardy Ferentschik
http://jazoon.com/Conference/Wednesday-22-June/Hardy-Ferentschik[presentation]
about Hibernate OGM: the bran new JBoss project which exposes the grid (
to be read Infinispan) through Hibernate's API.



Thank to Jazoon organizers for an excellent conference and the chance to
meet other enthusiasts from all over the world!



Cheers,

Mircea
