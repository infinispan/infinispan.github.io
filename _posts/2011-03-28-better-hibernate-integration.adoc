Hi,



Starting with 5.0 Infinispan's transaction support was
https://issues.jboss.org/browse/ISPN-888?focusedCommentId=12592115#comment-12592115[enhanced]
to allow Synchronization-based enlistment in transactions (v.s.
XAResource). A main use case for this is Hibernate's second level cache:
by using Synchronization the transaction manager doesn't have to write
the log on the disk. On the short, better performance!

You can read more about it
http://community.jboss.org/wiki/Infinispantransactions#Enlisting_Synchronization[here].
Thanks to Galder Zamarreno, the integration will be released together
with
http://opensource.atlassian.com/projects/hibernate/browse/HHH-6062[HHH-6062].



Cheers,

Mircea
