In the run-up to preparing Infinispan for a public release, we've been
busy on a number of interesting things, which have led to a decision to
release another CR instead.



The main driver behind this is that we've finally managed to get our
hands on a sizeable cluster large enough to truly test scalability.
Expect interesting public benchmarks to be published soon, watch this
space. (I recently
http://infinispan.blogspot.com/2010/02/infinispan-as-local-cache.html[blogged
about some local-mode benchmarks])



To enable such benchmarks, we've renewed efforts on building out the
http://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/cachebenchfwk/wiki[Cache Benchmarking
Framework]. This framework was originally a part of JBoss Cache's
http://anonsvn.jboss.org/repos/jbosscache/benchmarks/benchmark-fwk/trunk/[source
tree], and has now been extracted and migrated to SourceForge. We
welcome others contributing additional plugins for more distributed
cache/data grid products, as well as more tests and access patterns.



Finally, extensive community feedback over the past few weeks have
resulted in lots of bugs fixed and performance patches applied. Also, we
finally have http://code.google.com/p/jclouds/[a beta release of
JClouds] and an all-new
http://fisheye.jboss.org/browse/Infinispan/trunk/cachestore/cloud/src/main/java/org/infinispan/loaders/cloud/CloudCacheStoreConfig.java?r=1430[CloudCacheStore]
for folks to play with.



The release is available in its
http://www.jboss.org/infinispan/downloads[usual place.] I look forward
to getting
http://community.jboss.org/en/infinispan?view=discussions[feedback] on
this release, this time truly a release candidate, i.e., one that,
unchanged, could very well become the final release.



Your last chance for feedback on this release, people!



Cheers

Manik
