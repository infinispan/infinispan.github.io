The first candidate release of the Infinispan 5.0 "Pagoa" series is out
now. The final features added include:

* Lock identifiers are now
http://docs.jboss.org/infinispan/5.0/apidocs/org/infinispan/util/concurrent/locks/LockManager.html#getLockId(java.lang.Object)[available]
to Infinispan users in order to help reorder lock acquisitions which
helps reduce the possibility of deadlocks.
* Infinispan now supports internationalization of messages as per the
rules http://community.jboss.org/docs/DOC-16738[here]. The
internationalization of messages is not yet available, but the
integration of JBoss Logging into Infinispan would allow it in an easy
way.
* In the last BETA we renamed the _lazyDeserialization_ XML element to
storeAsBinary but this resulted in previous XML configurations not been
valid any more. So, we've reinstated the _lazyDeserialization_ element
but if you use it, you'll see a WARN message indicating that you should
replace it with _storeAsBinary_.
* A very important change in the release is the change of the default
value for lock striping configuration. In previous releases, this used
to be enabled by default but as hinted in
http://community.jboss.org/wiki/LockingAndConcurrency#Lock_striping[its
documentation] this can cause deadlocks. So, after some debate, we've
decided to disable it by default.
* New EC2 demo available in the all zip distribution with examples of
distributed executors and map/reduce! Make sure you try it out :)

There's some other minor fixes as shown in the
https://issues.jboss.org/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?projectId=12310799&version=12316194[release

feedback coming. The Final version is not far away, so make sure you
test this CR! :)
