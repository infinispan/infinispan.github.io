Dear community, the second release candidate of Infinispan 7 is out!

As we approach final release, the main themes of this CR were bugfixes
and enhancements, many related to
http://infinispan.org/docs/7.0.x/user_guide/user_guide.html#_partition_handling[Partition
Handling]

Also included:


* Spring Cache Provider support for Spring 4.1 (thanks Sebastian
Łaskawiec)
* Infinispan caches can now be exposed as OSGI managed services (thanks
https://github.com/bibryam[Bilgin Ibryam] for the contribution!)
* Support for replicated caches on partition handling
* Cache.size( ) method now returns count across entire cluster instead
of local
