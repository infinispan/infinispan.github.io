Dear Infinispan community,

it is with great pleasure that we are announcing the release of
Infinispan 9.0.0.Alpha1 the first release of the Infinispan 9 series.

We plan to do many exciting things in Infinispan 9.x, and this release
is just one of many stepping-stones that will get us there. Here's
what's included with Alpha1:

* Graceful clustered shutdown / restart with persistent state
* The REST cache store has a shiny new Netty-based backend, courtesy of
Antoine Toulme
* and many, many bugfixes: consult our
https://issues.jboss.org/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?version=12329539&projectId=12310799[issue
tracker] for a list of things we have fixed. 

A new major release is also the moment to peform some "spring-cleaning"
(pun intended):

* We've removed Spring 3.x support
* We've removed our home-brew map/reduce implementation. By now you
should be using the wonderful
http://infinispan.org/docs/8.2.x/user_guide/user_guide.html#_streams[Streams-based
API] instead which are much nicer and provide better performance
* We've dropped our custom NotifyingListeners in favour of Java's
standard
https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/CompletableFuture.html[CompletableFuture]
