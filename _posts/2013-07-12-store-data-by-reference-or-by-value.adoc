Traditionally, Infinispan has always stored data by-reference. Once
clients store some data, clients can still modify entries via original
object references. This means that since client references are valid,
clients can make changes to entries in the cache using those references,
but these modifications are only local and you still need to call one of
the cache's put/replace... methods in order for changes to replicate.

Obviously, allowing clients to modify cache contents directly, without
any cache invocation, has some risks and that's why starting with
Infinispan 5.3.0.Final, it offers the possibility to store data by-value
instead. The way store-by-value is enabled is by
https://docs.jboss.org/author/x/IgQTB[enabling Infinispan to store data
in binary format and forcing it to do these binary transformations
eagerly].

We've also added an
https://docs.jboss.org/author/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=68454084[FAQ
entry] that clarifies this topic.
