We continue with the blog series on the experimental Functional Map API
which was released as part of Infinispan 8.0.0.Final. In this blog post
we'll be focusing on how to work with multiple entries at the same time.
For reference, here are the previous entries in the series:

Map Introduction]
. http://blog.infinispan.org/2015/09/functional-map-api-working-with-single.html[Working
with single entries]

The approach taken by the Functional Map API when working with multiple
keys is to provide a lazy, pull-style API. All multi-key operations take
a collection parameter which indicates the keys to work with (and
sometimes contain value information too), and a function to execute for
each key/value pair. Each function's ability depends on the entry view
received as function parameter, which changes depending on the
underlying map:

for https://docs.jboss.org/infinispan/8.0/apidocs/org/infinispan/commons/api/functional/FunctionalMap.ReadOnlyMap.html[ReadOnlyMap],

for https://docs.jboss.org/infinispan/8.0/apidocs/org/infinispan/commons/api/functional/FunctionalMap.WriteOnlyMap.html[WriteOnlyMap],
or
https://docs.jboss.org/infinispan/8.0/apidocs/org/infinispan/commons/api/functional/EntryView.ReadWriteEntryView.html[ReadWriteView]
for https://docs.jboss.org/infinispan/8.0/apidocs/org/infinispan/commons/api/functional/FunctionalMap.ReadWriteMap.html[ReadWriteMap].
The return type for all multi-key operations, except the ones from
https://docs.jboss.org/infinispan/8.0/apidocs/org/infinispan/commons/api/functional/FunctionalMap.WriteOnlyMap.html[WriteOnlyMap],
return an instance of
https://docs.jboss.org/infinispan/8.0/apidocs/org/infinispan/commons/api/functional/Traversable.html[Traversable]
which exposes methods for working with the returned data from each
function execution. Let's see an example:





This example demonstrates some of the key aspects of working with
multiple entries using the Functional Map API:

* As explained in the previous blog post, all data-handling methods
(including multi-key methods) for
https://docs.jboss.org/infinispan/8.0/apidocs/org/infinispan/commons/api/functional/FunctionalMap.WriteOnlyMap.html[WriteOnlyMap]
return
https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/CompletableFuture.html[CompletableFuture<Void>],
because there's nothing the function can provide that could not be
computed in advance or outside the function.
* Normally, the order of
the https://docs.jboss.org/infinispan/8.0/apidocs/org/infinispan/commons/api/functional/Traversable.html[Traversable] matches
the order of the input collection though this is not currently
guaranteed.

There is a special type of multi-key operations which work on all
keys/entries stored in Infinispan. The behaviour is very similar to the
multi-key operations shown above, with the exception that they do not
take a collection of keys (and/or values) as parameters:





There's a few interesting things to note about working with all entries
using the Functional Map API:

* When working with all entries, the order of the
https://docs.jboss.org/infinispan/8.0/apidocs/org/infinispan/commons/api/functional/Traversable.html[Traversable]
is not guaranteed.
* Read-only's
https://docs.jboss.org/infinispan/8.0/apidocs/org/infinispan/commons/api/functional/FunctionalMap.ReadOnlyMap.html#keys--[keys()]
and
https://docs.jboss.org/infinispan/8.0/apidocs/org/infinispan/commons/api/functional/FunctionalMap.ReadOnlyMap.html#entries--[entries()]
offer the possibility to traverse all keys and entries present in the
cache. When traversing entries, both keys and values including metadata
are available. Contrary to Java's
http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/ConcurrentMap.html[ConcurrentMap],
there's no possibility to navigate only the values (and metadata) since
there's little to be gained from such method and once a key's entry has
been retrieved, there's no extra cost to provide the key as well.

It's worth noting that when we sat down to think about how to work with
multiple entries, we considered having a push-style API where the user
would receive callbacks pushed as the entries to work with were located.
This is the approach that reactive APIs such as http://reactivex.io/[Rx]
follow, but we decided against using such APIs at this level for several
reasons:

. We have huge interest in providing a Rx-style API for Infinispan, but
we didn't want the core API to have a dependency on
http://reactivex.io/[Rx] or http://www.reactive-streams.org/[Reactive
Streams]. 
. We didn't want to reimplement a push-style async API since this is not
trivial to do and requires careful thinking, specially around
back-pressure and flow control.
. Push-style APIs require more work on the user side compared to
pull-style APIs.
. Pull-style APIs can still be lazy and partly asynchronous since the
user can decide to work with
the https://docs.jboss.org/infinispan/8.0/apidocs/org/infinispan/commons/api/functional/Traversable.html[Traversable] at
a later stage, and the separation between intermediate and terminating
operations provides a good abstraction to avoid unnecessary computation.

In fact, it is this desire to keep a clear separation between
intermediate and terminating operations at
https://docs.jboss.org/infinispan/8.0/apidocs/org/infinispan/commons/api/functional/Traversable.html[Traversable]
that has resulted in having no manual way to iterate over the
https://docs.jboss.org/infinispan/8.0/apidocs/org/infinispan/commons/api/functional/Traversable.html[Traversable].
In other words, there is no iterator() nor spliterator() methods in
https://docs.jboss.org/infinispan/8.0/apidocs/org/infinispan/commons/api/functional/Traversable.html[Traversable]
since these are often associated with manual, user-end iteration, and we
want to avoid such thing since in the majority of cases, Infinispan
knows best how to exactly iterate over the data.



In the next blog post, we'll be looking at how to work with listeners
using the Functional Map API.
