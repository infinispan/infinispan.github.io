In response to
http://agoncal.wordpress.com/2011/02/11/java-ee-7-i-have-a-few-dreams/[Antonio
Goncalves' blog post] on his wish list for Java EE 7 and particularly on
his comments around the inactive
http://jcp.org/en/jsr/summary?id=107[JSR-107] JCACHE spec, I'd like to
spend a few moments jotting down my thoughts on the subject.

To start with, I am on the JSR-107 expert group, representing Red Hat.
 I have also been in recent discussions with the JCP about the inactive
JSR and what can be done about it.

My feel is JSR-107 needs to be axed.  It's been inactive for way too
long, it is out of date, and the community is pretty jaded about it.  We
do, however, need a JSR around _distributed_ caches and in-memory data
grids.  There is definitely a need in the Java EE 7 umbrella
specification, particularly with increasing focus and alignment with
cloud.  Apps designed to scale would almost certainly need a
distributed, in-memory data grid.  If Java EE is to be the preferred
platform to build Software-as-a-Service offerings, scalability is
crucial.

So what should this _data grid JSR_ look like?  Well, let's start with
JSR-107.  After all, I didn't think there was anything _wrong_ with
JSR-107, just that it was too limiting/simplistic.

[.underline]#*What's in JSR-107?*#
A quick summary:

* Primary interface - #javax.cache.Cache# - extending
#j.u.c.ConcurrentMap#
* Adds ability to register, de-register and list event listeners
* Defines a #CacheLoader# interface for
loading/storing cached data
* Defines an #evict(K) #method, as well as the
support for different eviction algorithms
* Defines a ServiceLocator approach to loading the appropriate
implementation at runtime
* Defines a #CacheManager# interface to construct and
retrieve #Cache# instances



*[.underline]#What JSR-107 does _not_ cover - but should be included in
a Data Grid JSR#*
Over and above what JSR-107 proposed, I believe the following features
are crucial to a useful data grid standard:

JTA interoperability.  The ability to participate in transactions is
necessary, both as an XA resource and as a simple cache to front a
RDBMS, via JPA

* Define behaviour at certain stages of a tx's lifecycle, particularly
with regards to recovery

Should play nice with JPA's second level cache SPI

Define and mandate REPLICATION and DISTRIBUTION, as well as SYNCHRONOUS
and ASYNCHRONOUS versions of network communications

*[.underline]#These _could_ be useful in the JSR, but needs more thought
and discussion#*

* An asynchronous, #Future#-based API (See
Infinispan's http://community.jboss.org/wiki/AsynchronousAPI[Async API])
* XML-based config file standardisation (including an XSD)
* Standardise programmatic config bean interfaces



*[.underline]#Further interesting thoughts#*

These additional, NoSQL-like features would also be very interesting,
but probably more sense in a later revision of this JSR - both for the
sake of manageability as well as to allow more community
adoption/feedback on such APIs.
