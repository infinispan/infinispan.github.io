As developers, it's always easy for us to "forget" about documentation
and tutorials, and let them get out of date. And this is exactly what
happened with our
http://infinispan.org/docs/6.0.x/getting_started/getting_started.html#_using_infinispan_as_an_embedded_data_grid_in_java_se[clustered
cache tutorial].

Even though we kept updating the tutorial to use the latest
configuration style, the core of the tutorial was still assuming that
state transfer was disabled by default - something that we changed back
in Infinispan 5.0.0.Final.

This was causing a bit of confusion, so I'm happy to report that I've
updated the tutorial and I've removed all traces of the
ClusterValidation class. Now the tutorial allows you to start as many
nodes as you want, and it also shows how a joining node receives data
from the existing members during startup.
