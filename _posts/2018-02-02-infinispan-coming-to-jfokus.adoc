The Infinispan team is on the move again! After Katia's trip to
Snowcamp, it's my turn to head  to
https://www.jfokus.se/jfokus/[JFokus], Sweden's largest developer
conference.

For JFokus we've morphed the streaming data workshop we delivered last
year at
http://blog.infinispan.org/2017/11/merci-duchess-et-devoxx.html[Devoxx
Belgium] and
http://blog.infinispan.org/2017/11/back-from-madrid-jug-and-codemotion.html[Codemotion
Madrid] into a
https://www.jfokus.se/jfokus/talks.jsp#Real-timeStreamingDa[3 hour long
deep dive tutorial]. This will be delivered *Monday 5th February at
13:30* local time.

On top of that, I'll be delivering a talk on
https://www.jfokus.se/jfokus/talks.jsp#StreamingDataAnalysi[streaming
data analysis with Kubernetes] where Infinispan will be featured. If
you're interested make sure you come on *Tuesday, 6th February at 14:00*
local time.

So, if you're coming to JFokus and you're interesting in data grids,
streaming data or similar topics, make sure you attend our talks.

Cheers,
Galder
