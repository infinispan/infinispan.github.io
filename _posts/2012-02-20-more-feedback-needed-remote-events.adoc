With 7 votes already, https://issues.jboss.org/browse/ISPN-374[remote
event handling] in Hot Rod is
https://issues.jboss.org/browse/ISPN#selectedTab=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.project%3Apopularissues-panel[one
of the most demanded features] in Infinispan, and we've just started
designing it. You can find out more about the design in
https://community.jboss.org/docs/DOC-17571[this article] and I've also
started a Infinispan Development mailing list discussion in order to
http://lists.jboss.org/pipermail/infinispan-dev/2012-February/010239.html[open
a debate] on this article.

Remember that remote event handling is the key piece that allows
https://www.jboss.org/dms/judcon/presentations/London2011/day1track2session2.pdf[near-cache
like patterns] to be built in Infinispan and we know for a fact that
this is one of the most demanded Infinispan patterns. So, if you have an
interest in near caches, please provide any feedback you might have on
the kind of event subscriptions and notifications you're interested.

To provide feedback, either comment on the
https://community.jboss.org/wiki/DesignOfRemoteEventHandlingInHotRod[linked
article], or join
https://lists.jboss.org/mailman/listinfo/infinispan-dev[Infinispan's
Development mailing list] and reply to the mail thread.

Cheers,
Galder
