Introducing the
http://www.jboss.org/community/wiki/InfinispanRESTserver[Infinispan
RESTful server] !

The Infinispan RESTful server combines the whole grain goodness of
http://www.jboss.org/resteasy/[RESTEasy] (JAX-RS, or JSR-311) with
Infinispan to provide a web-ready RESTful data grid.



Recently I (Michael) spoke to Manik about an interesting use case, and
he indicated great interest in such a server. It wasn't a huge amount of
work to do the initial version - given that JAX-RS is designed to make
things easy.



For those that don't know: RESTful design is using the well proven and
established http/web standards for providing services (as a simple
alternative to WS-*) - if that still isn't enough, you can read more
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_State_Transfer[here]. So
for Infinispan that means that any type of client can place data in the
Infinispan grid.

So what would you use it for?
For non java clients, or clients where you need to use HTTP as the
transport mechanism for caching/data grid needs. A content delivery
network (?) - push data into the grid, let Infinispan spread it around
and serve it out via the nearest server. See here for details on using
http://www.jboss.org/community/wiki/AccessingdatainInfinispanviaRESTfulinterface[http
and URLs] with it.

In terms of clients - you only need HTTP - no binary dependencies or
libraries needed (the wiki page has some
http://www.jboss.org/community/wiki/InfinispanRESTserver[samples] in
ruby/python, also in the project source).

Where does it live?
The server is a module in Infinispan under /server/rest (for the moment,
we may re-arrange the sources at a later date).

Getting it.
Currently you can download the war from the
http://www.jboss.org/community/wiki/InfinispanRESTserver[wiki page,] or
build it yourself (as it is still new, early days). This is at present a
war file (tested on JBoss AS and Jetty) which should work in most
containers - we plan to deliver a stand alone server (with an embedded
JBoss AS) Real Soon Now.

Questions: (find me on the dev list, or poke around the wiki).

in scala: After chatting with Manik and co, we decided this would serve
as a good test bed to "test the waters" on Scala - so this module is
written in scala - it worked just fine with RESTEasy, and Infinispan
(which one would reasonably expect, but nice when things do work as
advertised !).
