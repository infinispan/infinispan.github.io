If you want to get your feet wet with Infinispan, but you thought the
idea a bit daunting, you should worry no longer !
We have developed a very simple application which starts without
Infinispan, and, step by step, grows into a fully-fledged distributed
application complete with clustered listeners, externalizers and
map/reduce. http://infinispan.org/tutorials/embedded/[Check it out] in
our new http://infinispan.org/tutorials/[tutorials section]. We will
soon be adding more tutorials exploring different aspects of Infinispan.
