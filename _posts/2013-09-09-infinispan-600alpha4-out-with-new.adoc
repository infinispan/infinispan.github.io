Infinispan 6.0.0.Alpha4 is now with a few very important changes,
particularly around cache stores. We've completely revamped the cache
store/loader API to align it a bit better with JSR-107 (old CacheStore
has become CacheWriter) and to simplify creation of new implementations.
The new
https://github.com/infinispan/infinispan/blob/6.0.0.Alpha4/core/src/main/java/org/infinispan/persistence/spi/CacheLoader.java[CacheLoader]
and
https://github.com/infinispan/infinispan/blob/6.0.0.Alpha4/core/src/main/java/org/infinispan/persistence/spi/CacheWriter.java[CacheWriter]
should help implementors focus on the important operations and reduce
the coding time. We've also created
https://github.com/infinispan/infinispan/blob/6.0.0.Alpha4/core/src/main/java/org/infinispan/persistence/spi/AdvancedCacheLoader.java[AdvancedCacheLoader]
and
https://github.com/infinispan/infinispan/blob/6.0.0.Alpha4/core/src/main/java/org/infinispan/persistence/spi/AdvancedCacheWriter.java[AdvancedCacheWriter]
in order to separate for bulk operations or purging for those
implementations that wish optionally implement them. Expect a blog post
from Mircea in the next few days providing many more details on this
topic.

This new Infinispan version comes with other important goodies:

* Rolling upgrades of a Infinsipan REST cluster
* Support for Cache-Control headers for REST operations
* Remote querying server modules and Hot Rod client update
* REST and LevelDB stores added to Infinispan Server
* https://github.com/infinispan/infinispan/blob/6.0.0.Alpha4/core/src/main/java/org/infinispan/notifications/KeyFilter.java[KeyFilters]
can now be applied to Cache listeners
* Allow Cache listener events to be invoked only on the primary data
owner
