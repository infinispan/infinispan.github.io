http://community.jboss.org/polls/1074[polls are in], and Infinispan 5.1,
following tradition of naming releases after quality beers around the
world, will be codenamed _Brahma_, from Brazil.

Beer aside, _Brahma_ is a continuation of the work started with
Infinispan 5.0 _Pagoa._  Some of the key features of _Brahma_ include:

* Overhaul rehashing and state transfer.  This codebase will be
https://issues.jboss.org/browse/ISPN-1194[consolidated] and
significantly improved, starting with the
https://issues.jboss.org/browse/ISPN-1000[PUSH based rehashing]
introduced in _Pagoa_.
 https://issues.jboss.org/browse/ISPN-284[Chunking] and parallel
transfers will also be supported, which will improve the performance and
robustness of rehashing/state transfer.
* Improved locking and JTA interactions, including
https://issues.jboss.org/browse/ISPN-1132[deadlock-minimising
reordering] and https://issues.jboss.org/browse/ISPN-61[true optimistic
and pessimistic] modes.
* https://issues.jboss.org/browse/ISPN-1116[Versioned entries] and an
eventually consistent mode and API.  Infinispan has always leaned
towards consistency in the
http://www.julianbrowne.com/article/viewer/brewers-cap-theorem[CAP
triangle] at the expense of partition tolerance, in line with most Java
Data Grids.  However, we can very easily also
https://issues.jboss.org/browse/ISPN-999[support eventual consistency
with partition tolerance], and in _Brahma_ we intend to introduce the
versioned API to support this.
* https://issues.jboss.org/browse/ISPN-200[Distributed querying] based
on parallelising a query task across all nodes in the cluster should
also make an appearance, an additional query mode to add to the Lucene
index-based querying supported in _Pagoa_.

In addition to these big features, a number of smaller enhancements and
improvements are also planned, including:

* https://issues.jboss.org/browse/ISPN-1115[Fine-grained
AtomicHashMaps].  Anyone using AtomicHashMaps - including Hibernate OGM
"will love this!",
* https://issues.jboss.org/browse/ISPN-1103[Top-level support for JSON
documents], including fine-grained replication for deltas in JSON
documents.
* https://issues.jboss.org/browse/ISPN-1065[Moving off JAXB for
configuration parsing], JAXB being too slow and cumbersome to deal with.

So as we come ever closer to releasing _Pagoa_ in its final form,
contributors have already started hacking on code for _Brahma_.  Expect
to see alphas of _Brahma_ hit the interwebs very soon!



Enjoy
