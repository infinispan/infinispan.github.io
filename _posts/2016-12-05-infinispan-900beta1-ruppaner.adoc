It took us quite a bit to get here, but we're finally ready to announce
Infinispan 9.0.0.Beta1, which comes loaded with a ton of goodies.


Performance improvements

* JGroups 4
* A new algorithm for non-transactional writes (aka the Triangle) which
reduces the number of RPCs required when performing writes 
* A new faster internal marshaller which produced smaller payloads. 
* A new asynchronous interceptor core

Off-Heap support

* Avoid the size of the data in the caches affecting your GC times

container

* Superior performance
* More reliable eviction

Ickle, Infinispan's new query language

* A limited yet powerful subset of JPQL
* Supports full-text predicates

The Server Admin console now supports both Standalone and Domain modes

Pluggable marshallers for Kryo and ProtoStuff

The LevelDB cache store has been replaced with the better-maintained and
faster http://rocksdb.org/[RocksDB] 

Spring Session support

Upgraded Spring to 4.3.4.RELEASE

We will be blogging about the above in detail over the coming weeks,
including benchmarks and tutorials.

The following improvements were also present in our previous Alpha
releases:

Graceful clustered shutdown / restart with persistent state

Support for streaming values over Hot Rod, useful when you are dealing
with very large entries

Cloud and Containers

* Out-of-the box support for Kubernetes discovery

Cache store improvements

* The JDBC cache store now use transactions and upserts. Also the
internal connection pool is now based on
https://brettwooldridge.github.io/HikariCP/[HikariCP]


Also, our documentation has received a big overhaul and we believe it is
vastly superior than before.

There will be one more Beta including further performance improvements
as well as additional features, so stay tuned.

Infinispan 9 is codenamed "Ruppaner" in honor of the
http://www.ruppaner-bodensee.de/die-brauerei/[Konstanz brewery], since
many of the improvements of this release have been brewed on the shores
of the Bodensee !

Prost!
