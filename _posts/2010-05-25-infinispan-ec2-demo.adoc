Infinispan's distributed mode is well suited to handling large datasets
and scaling the clustered cache by adding nodes as required. These days
when inexpensive scaling is thought of, cloud computing immediately
comes to mind.

One of the largest providers of cloud computing is Amazon with its
Amazon Web Services (AWS) offering. AWS provides computing capacity on
demand with its EC2 services and storage on demand with its S3 and EBS
offerings. EC2 provides just an operating system to run on and it is a
relatively straightforward process to get an Infinispan cluster running
on EC2. However there is one gotcha, EC2 does not support UDP
multicasting at this time and this is the default node discovery
approach used by Infinispan to detect nodes running in a cluster.

Some background on network communications

Infinispan uses the JGroups library to handle all network
communications. JGroups enables cluster node detection, a process called
discovery, and reliable data transfer between nodes. JGroups also
handles the process of nodes entering and exiting the cluster and master
node determination for the cluster.

*Configuring JGroups in Infinispan*
The JGroups configuration details are passed to Infinispan in the
infinispan configuration file

[source,xml]
----
<transport clusterName="infinispan-cluster" distributedSyncTimeout="50000"
        transportClass="org.infinispan.remoting.transport.jgroups.JGroupsTransport">
    <properties>
       <property name="configurationFile" value="jgroups-s3_ping-aws.xml" />
    </properties>
 </transport>
 
----

*Node Discovery*

JGroups has three discovery options which can be used for node discovery
on EC2.

The first is to statically configure the address of each node in the
cluster in each of the nodes peers. This simplifies discovery but is not
suitable when the IP addresses of each node is dynamic or nodes are
added and removed on demand.

The second method is to use a Gossip Router. This is an external Java
process which runs and waits for connections from potential cluster
nodes. Each node in the cluster needs to be configured with the ip
address and port that the Gossip Router is listening on. At node
initialization, the node connects to the gossip router and retrieves the
list of other nodes in the cluster.

Example JGroups gossip router configuration



[source,xml]
----
<config>
   <TCP bind_port="7800" />
   <TCPGOSSIP timeout="3000" initial_hosts="192.168.1.20[12000]"
                  num_initial_members="3" />
   <MERGE2 max_interval="30000" min_interval="10000" />
   <FD_SOCK start_port="9777" />
   ... 
</config>
----

The `infinispan-4.1.0-SNAPSHOT/etc/config-samples/` directory has sample
configuration files for use with the Gossip Router. The approach works
well but the dependency on an external process can be limiting.

The third method is to use the new `S3_PING` protocol that has been
added to JGroups. Using this the user configures a S3 bucket (location)
where each node in the cluster will store its connection details and
upon startup each node will see the other nodes in the cluster. This
avoids having to have a separate process for node discovery and gets
around the static configuration of nodes.

Example JGroups configuration using the `S3_PING` protocol:

[source,xml]
----
<config>
    <TCP bind_port="7800" />
    <S3_PING secret_access_key="secretaccess_key" access_key="access_key"
                location=s3_bucket_location" />
    <MERGE2 max_interval="30000" min_interval="10000" />
    <FD_SOCK start_port="9777" />
    ...
</config>

EC2 demo

The purpose of this demo is to show how an Infinispan cache running on
EC2 can easily form a cluster and retrieve data seamlessly across the
nodes in the cluster. The addition of any subsequent Infinispan nodes to
the cluster automatically distribute the existing data and offer higher
availability in the case of node failure.

To demonstrate Infinispan, data is required to be added to nodes in the
cluster. We will use one of the many public datasets that Amazon host on
AWS, the
http://developer.amazonwebservices.com/connect/entry.jspa?externalID=2419&categoryID=246[influenza
virus] dataset publicly made available by Amazon.

This dataset has a number components which make it suitable for the
demo. First of all it is not a trivial dataset, there are over 200,000
records. Secondly there are internal relationships within the data which
can be used to demonstrate retrieving data from different cache nodes.
The data is made up for viruses, nucleotides and proteins, each
influenza virus has a related nucleotide and each nucleotide has one or
more proteins. Each are stored in their own cache instance.

The caches are populated as follows :

* *InfluenzaCache* - populated with data read from the `Influenza.dat`
file, approx 82,000 entries
* *ProteinCache* - populated with data read from the `Influenza_aa.dat`
file, approx 102,000 entries
* *NucleotideCache* - populated with data read from the
`Influenza_na.dat` file, approx 82,000 entries

The demo requires 4 small EC2 instances running Linux, one instance for
each cache node and one for the Jboss application server which runs the
UI. Each node has to have http://java.sun.com/javase/6/[Sun JDK 1.6]
installed in order to run the demos. In order to use the Web-based GUI,
http://www.jboss.org/jbossas/downloads.html[JBoss AS 5] should also be
installed on one node.

In order for the nodes to communicate with each other the EC2 firewall
needs to be modified. Each node should have the following ports open:

* TCP 22 – For SSH access
* TCP 7800 to TCP 7810 – used for JGroups cluster communications
* TCP 8080 – Only required for the node running the AS5 instance in
order to access the Web UI.
* TCP 9777 - Required for FD_SOCK, the socket based failure detection
module of the JGroups stack.

To run the demo,
http://sourceforge.net/projects/infinispan/files/[download] the
Infinispan "all" distribution, (`infinispan-xxx-all.zip`) to a directory
on each node and unzip the archive.

Edit the `etc/config-samples/ec2-demo/jgroups-s3_ping-aws.xml` file to
add the correct AWS S3 security credentials and bucket name.

Start the one of the cache instances on each node using one of the
following scripts from the `bin` directory:

* `runEC2Demo-influenza.sh`
* `runEC2Demo-nucleotide.sh`
* `runEC2Demo-protein.sh`

Each script will startup and display the following information :

....

Items of interest in the output are the *Cache Address* lines which
display the address of the nodes in the cluster. Also of note is the
*Protein/Influenza/Nucleotide* line which displays the number of entries
in each cache. As other caches are starting up these numbers will change
as cache entries are dynamically moved around through out the Infinispan
cluster.

To use the web based UI we first of all need to let the server know
where the Infinispan configuration files are kept. To do this edit the
`jboss-5.1.0.GA/bin/run.conf` file and add the line

[source,sh]
----
JAVA_OPTS="$JAVA_OPTS -DCFGPath=/opt/infinispan-4.1.0-SNAPSHOT/etc/config-samples/ec2-demo/"
----

at the bottom. Replace the path as appropriate.

Now start the Jboss application server using the default profile e.g.
`run.sh -c default -b xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx`, where “xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx” is the
public IP address of the node that the AS is running on.

Then drop the `infinispan-ec2-demoui.war` into the jboss-5.1.0.GA
`/server/default/deploy` directory.

Finally point your web browser to
`http://public-ip-address:8080/infinispan-ec2-demoui` and the following
page will appear.

The search criteria is the values in the first column of the
`/etc/Amazon-TestData/influenza.dat` file e.g. `AB000604`, `AB000612`,
etc.

Note that this demo will be available in Infinispan 4.1.0.BETA2 onwards.
If you are impatient, you can always build it yourself from Infinispan's
source code repository.


Enjoy,
