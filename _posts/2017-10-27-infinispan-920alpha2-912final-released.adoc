Dear Infinispan Community,

We have 2 new releases ready for everyone. We have our newest and
greatest, 9.2.0.Alpha2 and an updated Final for our stable branch 9.1.2.
As usual, both can be found on our
download http://infinispan.org/download/[page].

9.2.0.Alpha2 contain the following new features


* New Counters can be removed
https://issues.jboss.org/browse/ISPN-8093[ISPN-8093]
* Interoperability between JSON and Protobuf, allowing to retrieve
Protobuf content (written via Hot Rod) as JSON via Rest; also JSON
documents written via Rest can be automatically converted to Protobuf
and indexed. https://issues.jboss.org/browse/ISPN-7422[ISPN-7422]
* Wildcard cache configurations allowing for multiple caches from 1
config https://issues.jboss.org/browse/ISPN-8379[ISPN-8379]
* Reactive streams based iterator implementation providing better
throughput and less resources usage
https://issues.jboss.org/browse/ISPN-7865[ISPN-7865]
* An experimental evalAll like method on the LockedStream interface
allowing for exclusive operation on entries and a return value
https://issues.jboss.org/browse/ISPN-8310[ISPN-8310]


9.1.2.Final and  9.2.0.Alpha both added


* Updates to third party JGroups, Hibernate and Hibernate Search
* Off heap improvements and fixes for Query & Encoding


Besides these there were also quite a few bug fixes and code clean ups.
