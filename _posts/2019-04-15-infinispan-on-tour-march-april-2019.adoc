== Breizh Camp

2019 has been BreizhCamp's 9th - Code Busters - edition and they
sold-out the conference in a matter of hours (wow).

I did not have the time to attend any talk. Unfortunately, due to my
personal schedule, I arrived on Thursday night, and I was presenting on
Friday after lunch. This was the second time I was giving this
presentation, but I did lot's of changes since the first time,
including:

* Big upgrades to my presentation look and feel¬†
* Harry-Potterize my

Vert.x and Infinispan can be found

On Friday morning I was stressed and I ran my presentation at the hotel.
I arrived at the venue, delivered my talk and headed back to Paris. I
deeply regretted not spending more time hanging out with other speakers
and attendees, but I really couldn't make it this time :(


== Greach Conf

Greach Conf is a lovely conference held in Madrid (Spain) for several
years now. A 100% international conference, it has been organized by the
Groovy community.¬†

This year they have changed the conference lineup adding an
Android/Testing track and focusing on a bigger spectrum of technologies
around the JVM.

I learned a bunch of new things, including content related to
https://sdkman.io/[SDKMan!], https://gradle.org/[Gradle], the future of
https://grails.org/[Grails] and of course,
https://micronaut.io/[Micronaut]. As the principal maintainer of
https://github.com/infinispan/infinispan-spring-boot[Spring-Boot and
Infinispan integration], Micronaut felt new and familiar at the same
time. I really enjoyed the workshop delivered by
https://twitter.com/alvaro_sanchez[Alvaro S√°nchez] who will be in
https://www.devoxx.fr/[Devoxx France]¬†this week. The framework *is
really impressive*. Give it a try!



*You will find on Twitter a complete thread about my Greach Conf
impressions:*

*Thanks to Breizh Camp, Greach Conf and Voxxed Days Milano for the
opportunity to share around distributed caches and for the amazing time
I've had during this month in each of the conferences.*



This tour is now over for a while but will continue before summer. I
will be presenting this talk (with upgrades, so stay tuned) in
https://devfest.gdglille.org/[Dev Fest Lille in June 2019]¬†(France), in
https://comunidadcode.com/[Comunidad CODE (Virtual talk)]¬†and
https://www.meetup.com/fr-FR/Software-Crafters-Bilbao/[Software Crafters
Bilbao]¬†in Spanish.


== *Devoxx France¬†*

https://www.devoxx.fr/[Devoxx France] is taking place this week in
Paris. *I will be there,* so if you want to chat about Distributed
caches, Datagrids, NoSQL Key-Value databases, or integration with your
favorite framework *feel free to reach me on twitter*!


There are lot's of *new features and Reactive APIs to be done for
Infinispan 10*, so my main focus will be there for a bit.



Stay Tuned And Happy Coding!
