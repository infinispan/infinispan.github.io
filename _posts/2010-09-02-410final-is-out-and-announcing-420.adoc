Yes, things have been quiet on this blog as of late, but a lot has been
going on.  Let's start with the big news.  After much work on feedback
reported on the last Radegast release candidate, Infinispan 4.1.0.FINAL
is finally ready.  Many thanks to the community who have worked
tirelessly in testing stuff, reporting stuff.

This is a very important release.  If you are using 4.0.0 (Starobrno), I
strongly recommend upgrading to Radegast as we have a whole host of big
fixes, performance improvements and new features for you.  A full
changelog is

on JIRA], but a few key features to note are

endpoints], a Java-based

and talk about it on the
http://community.jboss.org/en/infinispan?view=discussions[forums].  Tell
your friends about it, tweet about it.

The other interesting piece of news is the announcement of a 4.2.0
release.  We've decided to take a few key new features from 5.0.0 and
release them earlier, as 4.2.0 - codenamed _Ursus_.  If you are
interested in what's going to be in Ursus, have a look at

feature set], and expect a beta on Ursus pretty soon now!

Enjoy!
