We have recently released
https://github.com/infinispan/infinispan-spring-boot[infinispan-spring-boot-starter]
*2.0.0.Final*. This version supports
https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot[Spring Boot 2.1] and
http://infinispan.org/[Infinispan 9.4.0.Final].

Before this release, some important features - such as near caching -
were only configurable by code.
From now on, we can set all of the Hot Rod client configuration using
the *hotrod.properties* file or
the https://issues.jboss.org/browse/ISPN-9437[Spring application YAML].
The latter is an important community requirement we had.

Let's see how to speed up our applications performance
with http://infinispan.org/docs/stable/user_guide/user_guide.html#near_caching[near
caching]!



==

== Hot Rod

===  

Just as a quick reminder, Infinispan can be used embedded in your
application or in *client/server* mode. To connect you application to a
server you can use an http://infinispan.org/hotrod-clients/[Infinispan
Client] and the Infinispan
http://infinispan.org/docs/stable/user_guide/user_guide.html#hot_rod_server_usage[“Hot
Rod Protocol”]. Other protocols are available, such as REST, but Hot Rod
is the most recommended way since it is the one that supports most of
the Infinispan functionalities.


== Near cache



From the Infinispan
http://infinispan.org/docs/stable/user_guide/user_guide.html#near_caching[documentation]:
Hot Rod client can keep a local cache that stores recently used data.
Enabling near caching can significantly improve the performance of read
operations *get* and *getVersioned* since data can potentially be
located locally within the Hot Rod client instead of having to go
remote.


== When should I use it? 



Near caching can improve the performance of an application when most of
the accesses to a given cache are read-only and the accessed dataset is
relatively small.
When an application is doing lots of writes to a cache, invalidations,
evictions and updates to the near cache need to happen. In this scenario
we won't probably get much benefit.

As I said in the introduction, the good news is that *this feature can
be activated just by configuration*. Code doesn't change, so we can
measure the benefits, if such exist, in a very straightforward way.


== Spring-Boot



I have created a very simple application, available
https://github.com/infinispan-demos/infinispan-near-cache[here]. Maven,
Java 8 and an Infinispan server are required to run it. You can
http://downloads.jboss.org/infinispan/9.4.0.Final/infinispan-server-9.4.0.Final.zip[download
the server] or
use https://hub.docker.com/r/jboss/infinispan-server/[docker].


Docker: docker run -it -p 11222:11222
jboss/infinispan-server:9.4.0.Final

Standalone: PATH/infinispan-server-9.4.0.Final/bin/standalone.sh

Once the server is up and running, build the application using maven 

>> infinispan-near-cache: mvn clean install



=== Writer 


This application loads the required data to a remote cache: a list of
some of the Infinispan contributors over the last decade.



>> writer: mvn spring-boot:run





=== Reader 


The reader application does 10.000 accesses to the contributors cache.
Using a random id, I call 10.000 times the get method. The job gets done
in my laptop in ~4000 milliseconds.

>> reader-no-near-cache: mvn spring-boot:run





== Activating the near cache



I need to configure two properties:

* *Near Cache Mode:* DISABLED or INVALIDATED. Default value is DISABLED,
so I turn it on with *INVALIDATED*.
* *Max Entries:* Integer value that sets the max size of the near
caches. There is no default value, so I set up one.

The hotrod client configuration is [.underline]#for each client#,
[.underline]#not for each cache# (this might change in the future). With
that in mind, note that configuring the previous properties will
activate near caching *for all the caches*. If you need to activate it
just for *some of them*, add the following property:

* *Cache Name Pattern:*  String pattern. For example "i8n-.*" will
activate the near caching for all the caches whose name starts by
"i8n-".


Configuration can be placed in the *hotrod-client.properties*,
*Spring-boot configuration* or *code*.

=== hotrod-client.properties

**infinispan.client.hotrod.near_cache.mode=**INVALIDATED

**infinispan.client.hotrod.near_cache.max_entries=**40

*infinispan.client.hotrod.near_cache.cache_name_pattern=*i8n-.*



=== application.yaml (or properties)

*infinispan:*
   *remote:*
     *near-cache-mode:* INVALIDATED
     *near-cache-max-entries:* 10
     *near-cache-cache-name-pattern:* i8n-.*

===== code 

With the Infinispan Spring-Boot Starter, I can add custom configuration
using the *InfinispanRemoteCacheCustomizer*.




== Results



My dataset contains 25 contributors. If I activate the near cache with
max 12 entries and I run my reader again, I get the job done in ~1900
milliseconds, which is already an improvement. If I configure it to hold
the complete dataset, I get it done in ~220 milliseconds, which is a big
one!


=== Conclusions



Near caching can help us speed up our client applications if configured
properly. We can test our tuning easily because we only need to add some
configuration to the client. Finally, the
https://github.com/infinispan/infinispan-spring-boot[Spring-Boot
Infinispan Starter] helps us build services with Spring-Boot and
Infinispan. 



Further work will be done to help Spring-Boot users work with
Infinispan, so stay tuned! Any feedback on the starter or any
requirement from the community is more that welcome. Find us
