The first-ever http://www.jboss.org/events/JUDCon.html[JUDCon] kicked
off on Monday, and was very well received. It was good to see so many
from the Infinispan community, and be able to discuss ideas and thoughts
in detail.  I'm hoping to see even more Infinispan-related activity at
future JUDCon events.

The http://www.jboss.org/announcements/jbvterms.html[JBoss Community
Recognition Award] winners were also announced at JUDCon, and I was
really surprised to find that 4 of the 5 winners were Infinispan
contributors.  Sanne Grinovero, Alex Kluge, Phil van Dyck and Amin
Abbaspour - thanks for your participation in Infinispan, your peers have
recognised your contributions and have voted with mouse clicks!
 Congrats!

Given how many Infinispan engineers and contributors are at JBoss World
this week, we are having an open Infinispan 5.0 planning and roadmap
session.  So if you are around and would like to join in, this will be
at 4:00pm on Thursday, in Campground 1.  For those of you not able to
make it, discussions will continue via the usual channels of IRC and the
developer mailing list.

Now to prepare for my next talk ... :-)

Cheers
Manik
