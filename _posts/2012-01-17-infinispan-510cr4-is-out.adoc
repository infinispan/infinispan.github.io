Over the past week we've been busy profiling Infinispan, in particular
we've been trying to maximise the performance of Infinispan
transactional caches which received a major overhaul int the 5.1
'Brahma' series, and the result is that instead of going final, we've
decided to cut another candidate release, Infinispan 5.1.0.CR4 which is
now available for download from the
http://www.jboss.org/infinispan/downloads[usual place]. We're confident
that these improvements will be greatly appreciated by Infinispan
consumers such as Hibernate second-level-cache and JBoss Application
Server 7 HTTP session replication.

As part of the configuration and parser work, new configuration
documentation has generated which you can now find in
http://docs.jboss.org/infinispan/5.1/configdocs/.

As always, give it a spin to this new candidate release and
http://community.jboss.org/en/infinispan?view=discussions[let us know
what you think]. You can find detailed information on the issues fixed
in our
https://issues.jboss.org/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?projectId=12310799&version=12318854[release
notes].

Cheers,
Galder
