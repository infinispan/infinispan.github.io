We continue with the blog series on the experimental Functional Map API
which was released as part of
http://blog.infinispan.org/2015/08/infinispan-800final.html[Infinispan
8.0.0.Final]. In this blog post we'll be focusing on how to listen for
Functional Map events. For reference, here are the previous entries in
the series:

Map Introduction]
. http://blog.infinispan.org/2015/09/functional-map-api-working-with-single.html[Working
with single entries]

with multiple entries]

The first thing to notice about Functional Map listeners is that they
only send events post-event, so that means the events are received after
the event has happened. In contrast with Infinispan Cache listeners,
there are no pre-event listener invocations. The reason pre-events are
not available is because listeners are meant to be an opportunity to
find out what has happened, and having pre-events can sometimes hint as
if the listener was able to alter the execution of the operation, for
which the listener is not really suited. If interested in pre-events or
potentially altering the execution,
http://infinispan.org/docs/8.1.x/user_guide/user_guide.html#_custom_interceptors[plugging
custom interceptors] is the recommended solution.



Functional Map offers two type of event listeners: write-only operation
listeners and read-write operation listeners.



=== Write-Only Listeners



https://docs.jboss.org/infinispan/8.0/apidocs/org/infinispan/commons/api/functional/Listeners.WriteListeners.html[Write
listeners] enable users to register listeners for any cache entry write
events that happen in either a read-write or write-only functional map.



Listeners for write events cannot distinguish between cache entry
created and cache entry modify/update events because they don’t have
access to the previous value. All they know is that a new non-null entry
has been written. However, write event listeners can distinguish between
entry removals and cache entry create/modify-update events because they
can query what the new entry’s value via
https://docs.jboss.org/infinispan/8.0/apidocs/org/infinispan/commons/api/functional/EntryView.ReadEntryView.html#find--[ReadEntryView.find()]
method.



Adding a write listener is done via the WriteListeners interface which
is accessible via both
https://docs.jboss.org/infinispan/8.0/apidocs/org/infinispan/commons/api/functional/FunctionalMap.ReadWriteMap.html#listeners--[ReadWriteMap.listeners()]
and
https://docs.jboss.org/infinispan/8.0/apidocs/org/infinispan/commons/api/functional/FunctionalMap.WriteOnlyMap.html#listeners--[WriteOnlyMap.listeners()]
method. A write listener implementation can be defined either passing a
function to
https://docs.jboss.org/infinispan/8.0/apidocs/org/infinispan/commons/api/functional/Listeners.WriteListeners.html#onWrite-java.util.function.Consumer-[onWrite(Consumer<ReadEntryView<K,
V>>)] method, or passing a WriteListener implementation to
https://docs.jboss.org/infinispan/8.0/apidocs/org/infinispan/commons/api/functional/Listeners.WriteListeners.html#add-org.infinispan.commons.api.functional.Listeners.WriteListeners.WriteListener-[add(WriteListener<K,
V>)] method. Either way, all these methods return an
https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/AutoCloseable.html[AutoCloseable]
instance that can be used to de-register the function listener. Example
and expected output:





=== Read-Write Listeners



https://docs.jboss.org/infinispan/8.0/apidocs/org/infinispan/commons/api/functional/Listeners.ReadWriteListeners.html[Read-write
listeners] enable users to register listeners for cache entry created,
modified and removed events, and also register listeners for any cache
entry write events. Entry created, modified and removed events can only
be fired when these originate on a read-write functional map, since this
is the only one that guarantees that the previous value has been read,
and hence the differentiation between create, modified and removed can
be fully guaranteed.



Adding a read-write listener is done via the
https://docs.jboss.org/infinispan/8.0/apidocs/org/infinispan/commons/api/functional/Listeners.ReadWriteListeners.html[ReadWriteListeners]
interface which is accessible via
https://docs.jboss.org/infinispan/8.0/apidocs/org/infinispan/commons/api/functional/FunctionalMap.ReadWriteMap.html#listeners--[ReadWriteMap.listeners()]
method. If interested in only one of the event types, the simplest way
to add a listener is to pass a function to either
https://docs.jboss.org/infinispan/8.0/apidocs/org/infinispan/commons/api/functional/Listeners.ReadWriteListeners.ReadWriteListener.html#onCreate-org.infinispan.commons.api.functional.EntryView.ReadEntryView-[onCreate],
https://docs.jboss.org/infinispan/8.0/apidocs/org/infinispan/commons/api/functional/Listeners.ReadWriteListeners.ReadWriteListener.html#onModify-org.infinispan.commons.api.functional.EntryView.ReadEntryView-org.infinispan.commons.api.functional.EntryView.ReadEntryView-[onModify]
or
https://docs.jboss.org/infinispan/8.0/apidocs/org/infinispan/commons/api/functional/Listeners.ReadWriteListeners.ReadWriteListener.html#onRemove-org.infinispan.commons.api.functional.EntryView.ReadEntryView-[onRemove]
methods. Otherwise, if interested in multiple type of events, passing a
https://docs.jboss.org/infinispan/8.0/apidocs/org/infinispan/commons/api/functional/Listeners.ReadWriteListeners.ReadWriteListener.html[ReadWriteListener]
implementation via
https://docs.jboss.org/infinispan/8.0/apidocs/org/infinispan/commons/api/functional/Listeners.ReadWriteListeners.html#add-org.infinispan.commons.api.functional.Listeners.ReadWriteListeners.ReadWriteListener-[add(ReadWriteListener<K,
V>)] is the easiest. As with write-listeners, all these methods return
an AutoCloseable instance that can be used to de-register the listener.



Here's an example of adding a ReadWriteListener that handles multiple
type of events:





=== Closing Notes



More listener event types are yet to be implemented for Functional API,
such as expiration events or passivation/activation events. We are
capturing this future work and other improvements under the
https://issues.jboss.org/browse/ISPN-5704[ISPN-5704] issue.

We'd love to hear from you on how you are finding this new API. To
provide feedback or report any problems with it, head to our
http://infinispan.org/community/[user forums] and create a post there.



In next blog post in the series, we'll be looking into how to pass
per-invocation parameters to tweak operations.



Cheers,

Galder
