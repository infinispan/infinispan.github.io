I'll be presenting at this year's http://mow2012.dk/[Miralce Open World]
with
http://mow2012.dk/program/measuring-performance-and-capacity-planning-in-java-based-data-grids.aspx[a
talk] on how
http://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/radargun/wiki/WikiStart[Radargun] is
used for measuring Infinispan's performance. I think the topic is
interesting for anyone that needs to prototype applications built using
in-memory datagrids such as infinispan.
So if you are around and you are interested in this topic, or just want
to say hi, then look for the guy with the Infinispan t-shirt (and my
name on the badge)!

Cheers,
Mircea
