Ever since Infinispan 5.2 release we implemented fully distributed
execution of both map and reduce phases of MapReduceTask. For the map
phase, MapReduceTask hashes task input keys, groups them by execution
node N these keys are hashed to, and sends map function along input keys
to each node N. At node N map function gets invoked for each input key
and locally loaded corresponding value. However, map function on node N,
until recently, got invoked on a single thread regardless of the number
of key/value pairs. If we need to invoke map function on many key/value
pairs, things would sooner rather than later grind to a halt.

Similarly in order to complete reduce phase, MapReduceTask groups
intermediate KOut keys by execution node N they are hashed to. After
intermediate phase is completed, MapReduceTask sends a reduce command to
each node N where KOut keys are hashed. Once reduce command arrives on
target execution node, it looks up temporary cache belonging to
MapReduceTask and for each KOut key, grabs a list of VOut values, wraps
it with an Iterator and invokes reduce on it. However, even reduce
function, until recently, got invoked on a single thread, as well. Even
though, due to the nature of map/reduce paradigm, reduce entails
significantly smaller number of key/value function invocations compared
to a map, current single threaded execution model does not help to speed
things up.

Starting with Infinispan community release 7.0.0.Alpha1, map and reduce
task phases are executed in parallel. If the eviction is not configured
for the cache where key/value pairs involved in the map phase reside,
MapReduceTask uses fork/join work-stealing technique for parallel
execution of the map and reduce functions. Otherwise, we implement
parallel execution using a standard thread executor framework. Reduce
phase is always executed using fork/join work-stealing algorithm. Either
way, we are hoping that users' large map/reduce tasks will experience a
significant execution speedup. Â At the moment, we are conducting our own
performance tests and will get back to you with the results soon. Stay
tuned.
