I intended to post this last week; but thanks to Google's
http://twitter.com/#!/Blogger/status/68906573778518016[recent outage]
with Blogger.com (and the fact that I was traversing
the http://uk.ask.com/wiki/Crib_Goch[Crib Goch] ridge in a hailstorm
over the weekend), I've not been able to post this till today.

I've released 5.0.0.CR2, the latest in a series of release candidates on
the steady march to a final release of the 5.0 series.

Lots of things fixed here, including some crucial bugs reported against
CR1.  For a full list of changes, see
https://issues.jboss.org/secure/ConfigureReport.jspa?atl_token=AQZJ-FV3A-N91S-UDEU%7C3c8bdeb69d76be8d6b8478f3e69b8980ad5dbc85%7Clin&versions=12316416&sections=all&style=none&selectedProjectId=12310799&reportKey=org.jboss.labs.jira.plugin.release-notes-report-plugin%3Areleasenotes&Next=Next[JIRA].

In addition to bug fixes, we have a new module - Spring integration,
contributed by Olaf Bergner - which allows you to use Infinispan as a
backend to
http://static.springsource.org/spring/docs/3.1.0.M1/spring-framework-reference/html/cache.html[Spring
3.1's Cache API] instead of the ConcurrentMap or EHCache implementations
shipped with Spring.  You'd just need to include infinispan-spring.jar
and configure Spring to use one of the Infinispan providers,
https://github.com/infinispan/infinispan/blob/master/spring/src/test/resources/org/infinispan/spring/provider/sample/CachingBookDaoContextTest.xml[as
detailed here].  Thanks Olaf!

As per usual, please do take this out for a spin, give it a solid
bashing and let us know what you think.  :-)

Cheers
Manik
