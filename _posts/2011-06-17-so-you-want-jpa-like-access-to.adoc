Back in the early days of Infinispan (since our first public
announcement, in fact) we always had it in mind to expose a
http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Java_Persistence/What_is_JPA%3F[JPA]-like
layer to Infinispan.  Initially this was as a replacement to the
fine-grained replication that http://www.jboss.org/jbosscache[JBoss
Cache]'s
http://docs.jboss.org/jbosscache/2.0.0.GA/PojoCache/en/html_single/index.html#intro[POJO
Cache] variant offered, but it grew beyond just a technique to do
fine-grained replication on complex object graphs.  The fact that it
offered a familiar data storage API to Java developers was big.  Huge,
in fact.

So we realised JPA-on-Infinispan was firmly on the roadmap.  The
original plan was to implement the entire set of JPA APIs from scratch,
but this was a daunting and Herculean task.  After much discussion with
core Hibernate architects and Infinispan contributors Emmanuel Bernard
and Sanne Grinovero, we came to a decision that rather than implementing
all this from scratch, it served both Infinispan and the community
better to fork Hibernate's core http://www.hibernate.org/about/orm[ORM]
engine, and replace the relational database mappings with key/value
store mappings.  And we get to reuse the mature codebase of Hibernate's
session and transaction management, object graph dehydration code,
proxies, etc.

And Hibernate OGM (Object-Grid Mapping) was born.  After initial
experiments and even a large-scale public demo at the
http://www.jboss.org/jbw2011keynote[JBoss World 2011 Keynote], Emmanuel
has officially
http://in.relation.to/Bloggers/HibernateOGMBirthAnnouncement[blogged]
about the launch of Hibernate OGM.  Very exciting times, Infinispan now
has a JPA-like layer.  :-)

To reiterate a key point from Emmanuel's blog, Hibernate OGM is still in
its infancy.  It needs community participation to help it grow up and
mature.  This is where the Infinispan community should step in; consider
Hibernate OGM as Infinispan's JPA-like layer and get involved.  For more
details, please read
Emmanuel's http://in.relation.to/Bloggers/HibernateOGMBirthAnnouncement[announcement].

Enjoy!
