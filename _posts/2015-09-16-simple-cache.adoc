Infinispan *local caches* have several features that make it more than
just a map - expiration and eviction, listeners, statistics,
transactions, cache stores and so forth. However, this comes at a price
- due to all the hooks and object allocation, plain ConcurrentHashMap is
faster than local cache.

There are applications that need something in between - great
performance but some of those features, too. In our case, the motivation
were internal caches in Hibernate Second Level Cache. Therefore
Infinispan *8.0.1.Final* brings the *simple cache* - alternative
implementation of the _AdvancedCache_ interface optimized for maximum
performance when you need just the basics.

The table below shows which features are available in simple cache:


[cols=", ",options="header" ]
|========================================
|Feature |Availability
|Basic map-like API |✔
|Cache listeners (non-clustered) |✔
|Expiration |✔
|Eviction |✔
|Security |✔
|JMX access |✔
|Statistics |✔
|Transactions |✘
|Invocation batching |✘
|Persistence (cache stores and loader) |✘
|Map Reduce Framework |✘
|Distributed Executors Framework |✘
|Custom interceptors |✘
|Indexing (querying) |✘
|Compatibility (embedded/server) |✘
|Store as binary |✘
|========================================



Configuring simple cache is as simple as adding one attribute to the XML
configuration:



While configuration schema allows to set up the unsupported features,
doing so results in an exception when the cache is created.

You can also configure simple cache programmatically:



So, what kind of performance improvement can you expect? We had run
basic (single-threaded) benchmark using
http://openjdk.java.net/projects/code-tools/jmh/[JMH] and this is what
we got:


Implementation

Local cache

This gives us about 5✕ speedup for reads and 6✕ for writes. Your mileage
may vary, but it's certain that simple cache provides substantial
performance benefits.

So, if your use-case allows it, try out simple cache and let us know.
It's as simple as one configuration attribute!
