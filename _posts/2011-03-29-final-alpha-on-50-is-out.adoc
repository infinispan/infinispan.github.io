The final alpha release, 5.0.0.ALPHA4, has just been released with
plenty of goodies to play with:

* For end users, the biggest change is a further refinement of the
fluent API first introduced in ALPHA3. We've basically worked hard to
make it even more fluent and make it easier to quickly read and write
programmatic configuration. The end result can be found in this example
https://github.com/infinispan/infinispan/blob/5.0.0.ALPHA4/core/src/test/java/org/infinispan/config/ProgrammaticConfigurationTest.java[test
file]. Note that this changes are not compatible with 5.0.0.ALPHA3
fluent API.
* For those service providers who are extending Infinispan to provide
their own functionality, you can know extend Infinispan so that your own
commands can be sent to other Infinispan nodes. This helps solve
problems such as
http://opensource.atlassian.com/projects/hibernate/browse/HHH-3818[HHH-3818]
in more elegant way without needing to rely on listeners and special
types of objects. You can find examples of how to extend Infinispan to
build your own commands
https://github.com/infinispan/infinispan-sample-module[here], and please
note that as with any SPI, it requires a high understand of the code
involved, so use it with care.

There's some other minor API changes and fixes as show in the
https://issues.jboss.org/secure/IssueNavigator.jspa?reset=true&jqlQuery=project+%3D+ISPN+AND+fixVersion+%3D+%225.0.0.ALPHA4%22+AND+status+%3D+Resolved+ORDER+BY+priority+DESC[release
notes]. As always, please use the
http://community.jboss.org/en/infinispan?view=discussions[user forums]
to report back, grab the release
http://www.jboss.org/infinispan/downloads[here], enjoy and keep the
feedback coming.



Finally, the release for the first Beta in the 5.0 series will be very
short, so keep an eye for an announcement very soon!



Cheers,

Galder
