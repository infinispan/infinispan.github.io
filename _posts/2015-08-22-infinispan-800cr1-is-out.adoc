The first release candidate of Infinispan 8 is out, bringing 2 much
anticipated features: Continuous Queries
(https://issues.jboss.org/browse/ISPN-5417[ISPN-5417]) and notification
for expired cache entries
(https://issues.jboss.org/browse/ISPN-694[ISPN-694])

Apart from that, the Functional Java 8 API had some
https://github.com/infinispan/infinispan/pull/3656[refinements], and in
the server land it's now possible to configure thread-pools along with
the cache container
(https://issues.jboss.org/browse/ISPN-5687[ISPN-5687]).

Last but not least, lots of bug were fixed: please refer to the
