I will be presenting on Infinispan and its role in cloud storage, at Red
Hat's http://www.redhat.com/cloudcomputingforum/[Cloud Computing Forum]
on the 10th of February 2010.



This is a virtual event, where you get to attend from the comfort of
your desk. And although it is free, you do need to

beforehand so I recommend your doing so.
