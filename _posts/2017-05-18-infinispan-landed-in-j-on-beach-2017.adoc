Are you in Malaga for https://jonthebeach.com/[J On The Beach 2017] and
want to know more about functional reactive programming with Elm,
Node.js and Infinispan? Then, make sure you come to
https://jonthebeach.com/schedule[this talk] on Friday, 11am at Mollete
Hall. It's a fun, live coding talk that you just can't miss :)

Cheers,
Galder
