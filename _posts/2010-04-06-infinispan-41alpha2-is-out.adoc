We've just released Infinispan 4.1.0.Alpha2 with even more new
functionality for the community to play with. Over the past few weeks
we've been going backwards and forwards in the
http://lists.jboss.org/pipermail/infinispan-dev[Infinispan development
list] discussing Infinispan's binary client server protocol called
http://community.jboss.org/docs/DOC-14421[Hot Rod] and in 4.1.0.Alpha2
we're proud to present the first versions of the Hot Rod server and java
client implementations. Please visit
http://community.jboss.org/docs/DOC-15093[this wiki] to find out how to
use Hot Rod's java client client and server. Please note that certain
functionality such as clients receiving topology and hashing information
has not yet been implemented.

Besides, Infinispan 4.1.0.Alpha2 is the first release to feature the new
LIRS eviction policy and the new eviction design that batches updates,
which in combination should provide users with more efficient and
accurate eviction functionality.

Another cool feature added in this release is GridFileSystem: a new,
experimental API that exposes an Infinispan-backed data grid as a file
system. Specifically, the API works as an extension to the JDK's File,
InputStream and OutputStream classes. You can read more on
GridFileSystem http://community.jboss.org/wiki/GridFileSystem[here].

Finally, you can find the API docs for 4.1.0.Alpha2
http://docs.jboss.org/infinispan/4.1/apidocs[here] and again, please
consider this an unstable release that is meant to gather feedback on
the Hot Rod client/server modules and the new eviction design.

Cheers,
Galder & Mircea
