Infinispan Node.js client 0.6.0 is out now!! :)

As well as updating the client so that it understand the latest Hot Rod
protocols in Infinispan 9.4.0.Final, this version comes with native JSON
object support.

To make the Node.js client backwards compatible, the client still treats
key/value pairs as String by default. If you want to use native JSON
objects, you have to explicitly configure the Node.js client to do so
(see
https://github.com/infinispan/js-client#supported-data-types[example]).

Starting with this version, we've upgraded the base Node version
requirement to 8.11, which is the latest stable release branch at the
time of writing. With such upgrade, the client no longer needs to use
external promise dependency which was know to
https://issues.jboss.org/browse/HRJS-63[leak].

If you're a Node.js user and want to store data remotely in Infinispan
server instances, please give the client a go and tell us what you think
of it via our https://developer.jboss.org/en/infinispan/content[forum],
via our https://issues.jboss.org/projects/HRJS[issue tracker] or via
https://zulipchat.com/[Zulip] on
https://infinispan.zulipchat.com/[Infinispan channel].

Cheers
