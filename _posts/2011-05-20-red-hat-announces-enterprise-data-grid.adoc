One of the
http://www.redhat.com/about/news/prarchive/2011/Red-Hat-Introduces-JBoss-Enterprise-Data-Grid[big
announcements] at the recently-passed
http://www.redhat.com/summit/[JBoss World and Red Hat Summit]
conference/trade show held in Boston earlier this month was the new
Enterprise Data Grid, abbreviated to EDG.  I mentioned this very briefly
in my
http://infinispan.blogspot.com/2011/05/jboss-world-and-judcon-2011-recap.html[JBoss
World recap], but the subject deserves more in-depth comment.

Firstly, what is EDG?  It is a data grid platform, based on the open
source http://www.infinispan.org/[Infinispan] project (and hence the
relevance on this blog).  Just as Red Hat only offers support and
subscriptions for
http://www.jboss.com/products/platforms/application/[JBoss Enterprise
Application Platform] (EAP) and not the community
http://www.jboss.org/jbossas[JBoss Application Server] (AS) for its Java
EE server offering, Red Hat will only offer support and subscriptions
for EDG and not the community project, Infinispan.

I'm not going to go into details on the reasons behind this - this is
well documented in other areas
(http://www.redhat.com/software/rhelorfedora/[RHEL vs. Fedora], JBoss
EAP vs. JBoss AS, etc.) - and instead I'm going to talk about the first
release of EDG, labeled EDG 6.0.

EDG 6.0 - codenamed
http://www.stridingedge.net/wainwright%20fells/a-l%20fells/Helvellyn.htm[Striding
Edge, after the famous ridge on Helvellyn], in England's Lake District -
is based on Infinispan 5.x, and in addition to Infinispan libraries,
will also contain a runtime based on EAP 6.0.  A runtime?  Does a data
grid really need a runtime?  Well, sometimes, yes.  If you are running a
cluster of grid nodes and intend to access this cluster from a separate
application tier, over a network, then there needs to be a mechanism to
bootstrap that cluster.  Some of the latest innovations in AS 7 - the
magic behind EAP 6.0 - give us the ability to efficiently bootstrap an
Infinispan node with relevant server endpoints configured and running.

People have been asking for official support and consultancy around
Infinispan for a long while now - over two years.  We finally have this,
in the form of EDG.  If you are interested in getting on to an early
access programme for EDG, and gain access to alpha and beta releases of
EDG, register on http://www.jboss.com/edg6-early-access[this website].
