http://www.redhat.com/promo/summit/2010/[JBoss World/Red Hat Summit]
organisers have asked me to put together
http://summitblog.redhat.com/2010/04/12/boston-are-you-ready-for-infinispan/[a
short note] on what to expect at the conference with regards to
Infinispan, and this has been published on the conference website.  I
thought I'd share this with you as well.

addition to the conference, this is also the first time JBoss is running
http://www.jboss.org/events/JUDCon.html[JUDCon] (JBoss Users and
Developers Conference), a free event (limited on a first-come
first-served basis) for the community, also in Boston.  Be sure to sign
up as places are limited!

Look forward to seeing you there!
