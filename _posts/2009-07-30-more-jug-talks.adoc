http://www.linkedin.com/in/adrianforrestcole[Adrian Cole] and I recently
presented at a JUGs in Krakow and Dublin, on
http://www.infinispan.org[Infinispan] and
http://code.google.com/p/jclouds/[JClouds].

Krakow was great - and hot: 39 degree weather! (Don't we just love
global warming?) Anna Kolodziejczyk at http://proidea.org.pl/[Proidea]
(who also organises http://www.jdd.org.pl/[JDD]) organised the event,
which attracted an excited and interactive audience of about 40 people.
Dublin, beautiful as always, was a polar opposite in terms of weather: a
cloudy, windy and wet day, living up to its reputation. Luan O'Carroll
of http://www.dubjug.org/[DUBJUG] organised the event, at the plush
http://www.odessaclub.ie/[Odessa Club]. Again, an inquisitive audience
of about 35 people attended, with a lot of questions on the future of
data storage in clouds. Thomas Diesler of
http://jbossosgi.blogspot.com/[JBoss OSGi] fame made a surprise guest
appearance too.

In general, the talks have been very well received and have provoked
thought and discussion. As requested by many, I will soon be recording a
podcast of this talk and will make it available on this blog.

Apart from a JUG I hope to organise soon in London, the next time I
speak about Infinispan publicly will be at
http://infinispan.blogspot.com/2009/07/infinispanjbossworld.html[JBoss
World in September]. Hope to see you there!

Cheers
Manik
