After very busy last few weeks with
http://www.jboss.org/events/JUDCon.html[JUDCon] and
http://www.redhat.com/promo/summit/2010/[JBoss World/Red Hat Summit],
we're proud to release Infinispan 4.1.0.CR1, the first candidate release
of the Infinispan 4.1 series. The release is downloadable in the
http://www.jboss.org/infinispan/downloads[usual place].



A lot of work has gone into this release primarily with the aim of
stabilising new functionality wrote in previous beta/alpha versions.
Here are some of the highlights included in this release:

* An fantastic demo showing how to run Infinispan in EC2. Check
http://infinispan.blogspot.com/2010/05/infinispan-ec2-demo.html[Noel
O'Connor's blog last month] for more detailed information.
* Enable Hot Rod servers to
http://community.jboss.org/wiki/UsingHotRodServer[run behind a proxy] in
environments such as EC2, and make TCP buffers and TCP no delay flag
configurable for both the server and client.
* Important performance improvements for Infinispan based Lucene
directory and Hot Rod client and sever.
* To avoid confusion, the single jar distribution has been removed. The
two remaining distributions are: The bin distribution containing the
Infinispan modules and documentation, and the all distribution which
adds demos on top of that.

A more detailed changelog can be found
https://jira.jboss.org/browse/ISPN/fixforversion/12313672[here].



Finally, if you're a user of Infinispan 4.0 or 4.1, please make sure you
download and try this release out so that any outstanding issues are
fixed in time for the final release. Also, if you're interested in
finding out more about Infinispan's architecture, don't miss Manik's
