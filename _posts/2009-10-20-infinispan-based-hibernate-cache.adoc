Update (2009/11/13)! Infinispan 4.0.0.Beta2 based Hibernate second level
cache provider http://in.relation.to/12696.lace[now available in
Hibernate 3.5 Beta2]. However, neither Infinispan 4.0.0.Beta2 nor the
Infinispan Cache Provider jar are available in the zip distribution.
Instead, please download Infinispan 4.0.0.Beta2 from
http://sourceforge.net/projects/infinispan/files/[our download site] and
the Infinispan Cache Provider
http://repository.jboss.org/maven2/org/hibernate/hibernate-infinispan/3.5.0-Beta-2/[from
our Maven repository].

I've just finished the development of an Infinispan 4.0 based Hibernate
second level cache provider. This will be included from next Hibernate
3.5 release onwards but if you cannot wait and wanna play with it in the
mean time, just checkout
http://anonsvn.jboss.org/repos/hibernate/core/trunk/[Hibernate trunk
from our SVN repository] and run 'mvn install'.

I've also written http://www.jboss.org/community/docs/DOC-14105[a wiki
called "Using Infinispan as JPA/Hibernate Second Level Cache Provider" ]
that should help users understand how to configure the Infinispan cache
provider and how to make the most of it!

So, what's good about it? Why should I use it? First of all, since the
cache provider is based on Infinispan, you benefit from all the
improvements we've done to Infinispan in terms of performance and memory
consumption so far and there are more to come!

On top of that, starting with this cache provider, we're aiming to
reduce the number of files needed to modify in order to define the most
commonly tweaked parameters. So, for example, by enabling
eviction/expiration configuration on a per generic Hibernate data type
or particular entity/collection type via hibernate.cfg.xml or
persistence.xml, users don't have to touch to Infinispan's cache
configuration file any more. You can find detailed information on how to
do this in the http://www.jboss.org/community/docs/DOC-14105["Using
Infinispan as JPA/Hibernate Second Level Cache Provider" wiki]

Please direct any feedback to the
http://www.jboss.org/index.html?module=bb&op=viewforum&f=309[Infinispan
user forum].
