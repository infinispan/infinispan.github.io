Dear all, with the release of 7.0.0.Alpha3, Infinispan has finally
gained the ability to perform Access Control (aka Authorization) on
CacheManagers and Caches. This is the first stepping-stone towards the
full-fledged security work that will be completed during the 7.0
cycle.

Infinispan authorization is built around the standard security features
available in a JDK near you, such as JAAS and the SecurityManager.
Here's a worked example.


== Running within a SecurityManager

In order for Infinispan to be able to enforce access restrictions, you
should enable the SecurityManager in your JVM. This can be done from the
command-line:


....
java -Djava.security.manager ...
....


or programmatically:


....
System.setSecurityManager(new SecurityManager());
....


You don't have to use the default implementation that comes with the
JDK, but if you do you need to supply an appropriate policy file. The
Infinispan distribution comes with an example policy file which
illustrates the permissions required by some of Infinispan's JAR files.
Integrate these permissions with the ones required by your
application.

While Infinispan's authorization _can_ work without a SecurityManager
for the basic cache operations (put, get, etc), some more complex tasks
(distexec, map/reduce, query) will fail without one.

== Configuring Infinispan for authorization

Authorization in Infinispan is configured at two levels: at the cache
container and at the single cache.
Let's look at cache containers (aka CacheManagers) first:

Each cache container determines the following:

* whether to use authorization, via the _enabled_ attribute.Â 
* a class which will map the user's principals to a set of roles
* a set of named roles and the permissions they represent

We then need to define the specific roles for each cache:


As you can see you can choose to use only a subset of the roles defined
at the container level.

Before you can start using a secured cache, you need to get yourself a
_javax.security.auth.Subject_.

== Obtaining a Subject

Infinispan is not fussy about how you obtain a JAAS
http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/javax/security/auth/Subject.html[Subject]:
you may use your container's features, or a third-party library (such as
https://www.jboss.org/picketbox[JBoss PicketBox] or
https://shiro.apache.org/[Apache Shiro]). The important thing is that
your Subject should be populated with a set of
http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/security/Principal.html[Principals]
which represent the user and the groups it belongs to in your security
domain (e.g. LDAP, Active Directory, etc).
It is then the duty of the _mapper_ to look through the principals
associated with the Subject and convert them into roles suitable for
matching those you have defined at the container level.
Once you have a Subject, you interact with the Cache within the context
of a _PrivilegedAction_ as follows:


Obviously if you're lucky enough to use Java 8, you can use the
following, more concise, lambda-enabled code:
