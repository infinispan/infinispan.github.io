In this blog post we'll continue with the introduction of the
experimental Functional Map API, which was released as part of
http://blog.infinispan.org/2015/08/infinispan-800final.html[Infinispan
8.0.0.Final], focusing on how to manipulate data using single-key
operations.

As mentioned in the
http://blog.infinispan.org/2015/08/new-functional-map-api-in-infinispan-8.html[Functional
Map API introduction], there are three types of operations that can be
executed against a functional map: read-only operations (executed via
https://docs.jboss.org/infinispan/8.0/apidocs/org/infinispan/commons/api/functional/FunctionalMap.ReadOnlyMap.html[ReadOnlyMap]),
write-only operations (executed via
https://docs.jboss.org/infinispan/8.0/apidocs/org/infinispan/commons/api/functional/FunctionalMap.WriteOnlyMap.html[WriteOnlyMap]),
and read-write operations (executed via
https://docs.jboss.org/infinispan/8.0/apidocs/org/infinispan/commons/api/functional/FunctionalMap.ReadWriteMap.html[ReadWriteMap])
and .

Firstly, we need construct instances of
https://docs.jboss.org/infinispan/8.0/apidocs/org/infinispan/commons/api/functional/FunctionalMap.ReadOnlyMap.html[ReadOnlyMap],
https://docs.jboss.org/infinispan/8.0/apidocs/org/infinispan/commons/api/functional/FunctionalMap.WriteOnlyMap.html[WriteOnlyMap]
and
https://docs.jboss.org/infinispan/8.0/apidocs/org/infinispan/commons/api/functional/FunctionalMap.ReadWriteMap.html[ReadWriteMap]
to be able to work with them:


Next, let's see all three types of operations in action, chaining them
to store a single key/value pair along with some metadata, then read it
and finally delete a returning the previously stored data:


This example demonstrates some of the key aspects of working with single
entries using the Functional Map API:

* Single entry methods are asynchronous
returning https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/CompletableFuture.html[CompletableFuture] instances
which provide methods to compose and chain operations so that it can
feel is they're being executed sequentially. Unfortunately Java does not
have https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Haskell/do_notation[Haskell's do
notation] or http://docs.scala-lang.org/tutorials/FAQ/yield.html[Scala's
for comprehensions] to make it more palatable, but it's great news that
Java finally offers mechanisms to work with CompletableFutures in a
non-blocking way, even if they're a bit more verbose than what's
proposed in other languages.
* All data-handling methods for
https://docs.jboss.org/infinispan/8.0/apidocs/org/infinispan/commons/api/functional/FunctionalMap.WriteOnlyMap.html[WriteOnlyMap]
return
https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/CompletableFuture.html[CompletableFuture<Void>],
meaning that the user can find out when the operation has completed but
nothing else, because there's nothing the function can provide that
could not be computed in advance or outside the function.
* The return type for most of the data handling methods in
https://docs.jboss.org/infinispan/8.0/apidocs/org/infinispan/commons/api/functional/FunctionalMap.ReadOnlyMap.html[ReadOnlyMap]
(and
https://docs.jboss.org/infinispan/8.0/apidocs/org/infinispan/commons/api/functional/FunctionalMap.ReadWriteMap.html[ReadWriteMap])
are quite flexible. So, a function can decide to return value
information, or metadata, or for convenience, it can also return the
ReadEntryView it receives as parameter. This can be useful for users
wanting to return both value and metadata parameter information.
* The read-write operation demonstrated above showed how to remove an
entry and return the previously associated value. In this particular
case, we know there's a value associated with the entry and hence we
called
https://docs.jboss.org/infinispan/8.0/apidocs/org/infinispan/commons/api/functional/EntryView.ReadEntryView.html[ReadEntryView.get()]
directly, but if we were not sure if the value is present or
not, https://docs.jboss.org/infinispan/8.0/apidocs/org/infinispan/commons/api/functional/EntryView.ReadEntryView.html#find--[ReadEntryView.find()]
should be called and return the
https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Optional.html[Optional]
instance instead.
* In the example,
https://docs.jboss.org/infinispan/8.0/apidocs/org/infinispan/commons/api/functional/MetaParam.MetaLifespan.html[Lifespan
metadata parameter] is constructed using the new Java Time API available
in Java 8, but it could have been done equally
with http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/TimeUnit.html[java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit]
as long as the conversion was done to number of milliseconds during
which the entry should be accessible.
* Lifespan-based expiration works just as it does with other Infinispan
APIs, so you can easily modify the example to lower the lifespan, wait
for duration to pass and then verify that the value is not present any
more.

If storing a constant value,
https://docs.jboss.org/infinispan/8.0/apidocs/org/infinispan/commons/api/functional/FunctionalMap.WriteOnlyMap.html#eval-K-java.util.function.Consumer-[WriteOnlyMap.eval(K,
Consumer)] could be used instead
of https://docs.jboss.org/infinispan/8.0/apidocs/org/infinispan/commons/api/functional/FunctionalMap.WriteOnlyMap.html#eval-K-V-java.util.function.BiConsumer-[WriteOnlyMap.eval(K,
V, Consumer)], making the code clearer, but if the value is
variable, https://docs.jboss.org/infinispan/8.0/apidocs/org/infinispan/commons/api/functional/FunctionalMap.WriteOnlyMap.html#eval-K-V-java.util.function.BiConsumer-[WriteOnlyMap.eval(K,
V, Consumer)] should be used to avoid, as much as possible, functions
capturing external variables. Clearly, operations exposed by functional
map can't cover all scenarios and there might be situations where
external variables are captured by functions, but these should in
general, should be a minority. Here is as example showing how to
implement
http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/ConcurrentSkipListMap.html#replace-K-V-V-[ConcurrentMap.replace(K,
V, V)] where external variable capturing is required:





The reason we didn't add a WriteOnly.eval(K, V, V, Consumer) to the API
is because value-equality-based replace comparisons are just one type of
replace operations that could be executed. In other cases, metadata
parameter based comparison might be more suitable, e.g. Hot Rod replace
operation where version (a type of metadata parameter) equality is the
deciding factor to determine whether the replace should happen or not.

In the next blog post, we'll be looking at how to work with multiple
entries using the Functional Map API.
