= Infinispan 10.1 "Turia"

Hi there,

we finish 2019 in style with the Final release of Infinispan 10.1, codenamed https://www.cervezaturia.es["Turia"].

== Server console

The highlight of this release is the new server console which is now based on https://www.patternfly.org/v4/[Patterfly 4] and https://reactjs.org/[React.js].
We will soon have a blog post detailing the work that has been done and our future plans. In the meantime, here are a few screenshots:

== Security

Many changes related to security have happened since 10.0:

* Native SSL/TLS provided by https://github.com/wildfly-security/wildfly-openssl[WildFly OpenSSL]. The server only ships with native libraries for Linux x86_64, but you can download natives for other platforms and architectures
* Improved usability of the Hot Rod client configuration with better defaults
* Full support for authorization for admin operations via the RESTful endpoint
* Console authentication support
* Kerberos authentication for both Hot Rod (GSSAPI, GS2) and HTTP/Rest (SPNEGO)
* Improved LDAP realm configuration with connection tuning and attribute references
* Rewritten client/server security documentation including examples on how to create certificate chains, connecting to various LDAP directories and https://www.keycloak.org/[KeyCloak], etc.

== Server

* A command-line switch to specify an alternate logging configuration file
* Query and indexing operations/stats are now exposed over the RESTful API
* Tasks and Scripting support
* Support for binding the endpoints to 0.0.0.0 / ::0 (aka INADDR_ANY)

== Non-blocking

More work has landed on the quest to completely remove blocking calls from our internals. The following have been made non-blocking:

* State transfer
* The size operation
* Cache stream ops with primitive types

Additionally caches now have a reactive Publisher which is intended as a fully non-blocking approach to distributed operations.

== Query

* The query components have been reorganized so that they are more modular.

== Monitoring

* The introduction of histogram and timer metrics.
* The `/metrics` endpoint now includes `base` and `vendor` microprofile metrics

== Stores

* The REST cache store has been updated to use the v2 RESTful API.

== Removals and deprecations

* The old RESTful API (v1) has been partially reinstated until 11.0. Bulk ops are disabled.
* The Infinispan Lucene Directory has been deprecated.
* The memcached protocol server has been deprecated. If you were relying on this, come and talk to us about working on a binary protocol implementation.

== Bug fixes, clean-ups and documentation

Over 160 issues fixed including a lot of documentation updates. See the https://issues.redhat.com/issues/?filter=12344079[full list of changes and fixes]
