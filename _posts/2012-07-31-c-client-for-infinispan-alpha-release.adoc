A while ago I was
http://infinispan.blogspot.co.uk/search/label/gsoc[announcing] that
http://twitter.com/sunimalr[Sunimal Rathnayake] would start the work for
a C# Hot Rod  client for Infinispan as part of the
http://code.google.com/soc/[Google Summer of Code]. After 2 months of
heavy work Sunimal delivered an intelligence-one (basic client,
interested in neither cluster nor hash information) implementation.
The release distribution can be downloaded
from https://github.com/infinispan/dotnet-client/downloads[here].
Besides the required binaries and doclets, is also contains a sample
application showing how the client can
be configured and illustrating the basic operations with the server.
This and more are being described in the readme.txt file in the
distribution root.

And there's much more on the way! Sunimal is working on enhancing the
client to the intelligence-two level: topology-aware client, interested
in cluster information - stay tuned!

Please give it a try and don't hesitate to post your comments to our
https://community.jboss.org/en/infinispan?view=discussions[forums], the
http://www.jboss.org/infinispan/mailinglists[mailing list ] or
irc://irc.freenode.org/infinispan[contact us directly on IRC] for a
chat!

Cheers,
Mircea
