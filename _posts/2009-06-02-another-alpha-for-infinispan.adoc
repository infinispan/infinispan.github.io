Infinispan 4.0.0.ALPHA4 is ready for a sound thrashing.

What's new? Galder Zamarre√±o's recent contribution of ripping out the
marshalling framework Infinispan "inherited" from JBoss Cache and
replacing it with JBoss Marshalling has made the marshalling code much
leaner, more modular and more testable, and comes with a nifty
performance boost too. What's also interesting is that he has overcome
issues with object stream caching (see my blog on the subject) by using
JBoss Marshalling streams which can be reset. This too provides a very
handy performance boost for short lived streams. (See
https://jira.jboss.org/jira/browse/ISPN-42[ISPN-42],
https://jira.jboss.org/jira/browse/ISPN-84[ISPN-84])

Mircea Markus has put together a bunch of migration scripts to migrate
your JBoss Cache 3.x configuration to Infinispan. More migration scripts
are on their way. (See
https://jira.jboss.org/jira/browse/ISPN-53[ISPN-53],
https://jira.jboss.org/jira/browse/ISPN-54[ISPN-54])

Vladimir Blagojevic has contributed the new lock() API - which allows
for explicit, eager cluster-wide locks. (See
https://jira.jboss.org/jira/browse/ISPN-48[ISPN-48])

Heiko Rupp has contributed the early days of a JOPR plugin, allowing
Infinispan instances to be managed by
http://dandreadis.blogspot.com/2009/04/as-510cr1-with-embedded-jopr-is-out.html[JBoss
AS 5.1.0's embedded console] as well as other environments. Read his
guide to
http://www.jboss.org/community/wiki/MonitoringInfinispanwithJopr[managing
Infinispan with JOPR] for more details.

And I've implemented some enhancements to the Future API. Now, rather
than returning Futures, the xxxAsync() methods return a NotifyingFuture.
NotifyingFuture extends Future, adding the ability to register a
notifier such that the caller can be notified when the Future completes.
Note that Future completion could mean any of successful completion,
exception or cancellation, so the listener should check the state of the
Future using get() on notification. For example:


[source,java]
----
NotifyingFuture<Void> f = cache.clearAsync().attachListener(new FutureListener<Void>() {
 public void futureDone(Future<Void> f) {
   if (f.get() && !f.isCancelled()) {
     System.out.println("clear operation succeeded");
   }
 }
});
