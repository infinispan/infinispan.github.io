Dear Infinispanners,

The C++ and C# 8.3.0.Alpha1 releases are available!

Both the clients come with these new features:

* counter operations, to use https://infinispan.org/docs/stable/user_guide/user_guide.html#clustered_counters[cluster distributed counters]
* https://infinispan.org/docs/stable/user_guide/user_guide.html#hot_rod_admin_tasks[admin operations], to create/remove cache programmatically at runtime

For the .NET Core lovers, there's a work in progress to implement the
dotnet https://github.com/infinispan/dotnet-client/blob/master/README.md[core build] for the C# client.
Features list, code and bits are available https://github.com/infinispan/cpp-client[as usual].

Cheers,
The Infinispan Team
