OpenShift (and Kubernetes) has a great feature called
https://docs.openshift.org/latest/admin_guide/scheduler.html#affinity[Affinity].
In some scenarios, it might be beneficial to configure it along with
http://infinispan.org/docs/stable/user_guide/user_guide.html#ServerHinting[Infinispan
node affinity].

Before we start... this tutorial is heavily based on our
http://blog.infinispan.org/2016/08/running-infinispan-cluster-on-openshift.html[previous
blog post about deploying Infinispan on Openshift] and OpenShift
https://docs.openshift.org/latest/admin_guide/scheduler.html[Scheduler
functionality]. It is highly recommended to read those articles before
continuing this tutorial.

== How does the Affinity feature work... in short?

In order to decide on which node given Pod should be running, OpenShift
looks at so called
https://docs.openshift.org/latest/admin_guide/scheduler.html#configurable-predicates[Predicates]
and
https://docs.openshift.org/latest/admin_guide/scheduler.html#available-priority-functions[Priority
Functions]. A predicate must match the one configured in
_DeploymentConfiguration_ and Priority Function is responsible for
choosing the best node for running Pods.



Let's assume that we have a sample policy (similar to
https://docs.openshift.org/latest/admin_guide/scheduler.html#scheduler-sample-policies[one
provided in OpenShift manual]), that uses _site_ as a Predicate along
with _rack and machine_ as Priority Functions. Now let's assume we have
two nodes:

* Node 1 - site=EU, rack=R1, machine=VM1
* Node 2 - site=US, rack=R2, machine=VM2

And two DeploymentConfiguration with Node Selectors (this tells
OpenShift on which nodes given _DeploymentConfiguration_ wishes to run)
defined as follows:

* DeploymentConfiguration 1 - site=EU, rack=R5, machine=VM5
* DeploymentConfiguration 2 - site=JAP, rack=R5, machine=VM5

With the above example only DeploymentConfiguration 1 will be scheduled
(on Node 1), since _site_ matches the predicate. In this case _rack_ and
_machine_ parameters are not used (because we have only one node).



Note that the default OpenShift's configuration uses _region_ (as a
Predicate) and _zone_ (as a Priority Function). However it can be
reconfigured
https://docs.openshift.org/latest/admin_guide/scheduler.html[very
easily].

== And I need it because....



Some OpenShift deployments might span multiple racks in a data center or
even multiple sites. It is important to tell Infinispan where physical
machines are located, which will allow to choose better nodes for
backing up your data (in distribution mode). 



As the matter of fact, Infinispan uses _site_, _rack_ and _machine_. The
main goal is to avoid backing up data on the same host__.__



=== 

=== The implementation



The implementation is pretty straightforward but there are several
gotchas. 



The first one is that OpenShift uses _regions_ and _zones_ by default
and Infinispan uses _sites_, _racks_ and _machines_. The good news is
that all those three are optional, so you have two options - reuse
existing _region_ and _zone_ (map them to rack and site for example)_,_
or adjust OpenShift scheduler settings. In my example I used the former
approach.



The second one is the need of hardcoding those parameters into
_DeploymentConfiguration_. Unfortunately Node Selectors are not exposed
through http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/downward-api/[Downward
API], so there's no other way.



So let's have a look at our DeploymentConfiguration:



* Line 26 - Zone _default_ used as a rack
* Line 27 - Region _primary_ used as a site
* Lines 57 - 59 - Node Selector for scheduling Pods





=== Conclusion



Combining OpenShift Affinity Service and Infinispan Server Hinting
allows to optimize data distribution across the cluster. Keep in mind
that your configuration might be totally different (OpenShift Scheduler
is a highly configurable thing). But once you understand how it works,
you can adjust the hinting strategy for your needs. 



Happy Scaling!
