There are releases and releases. And this one is a big one, containing a
bran new state transfer functionality. Designed and implemented by
https://community.jboss.org/people/dan.berindei[Dan Berindei] and
https://community.jboss.org/people/anistor[Adrian Nistor], the new Non
Blocking State Transfer (NBST) has the following goals:

* Minimize the interval(s) where the entire cluster can't respond to
requests because of a state transfer in progress.
* Minimize the interval(s) where an existing member stops responding to
requests because of a state transfer in progress.
* Allow the performance of the cluster to drop during state transfer,
but it should not throw any exception

Curious to see the magic behind it?
 https://community.jboss.org/wiki/Non-BlockingStateTransferV2[This
document] is here to explain you NBST's internal.



Besides NBST this release brings some other goodies:

* A new IGNORE_RETURN_VALUES flag to help reduce the number of RPC calls
and increasing performance (to be discussed at large
by http://galder.zamarreno.com/[Galder Zamarreño] in a following blog
post)  
* A revamped and *much* nicer configuration for submodules such as cache
loaders. More about it in
 http://infinispan.blogspot.co.uk/2012/08/configuration-overhaul.html[Tristan
Tarrant's blog]
* for a complete list of the
fixes/enhancements https://issues.jboss.org/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?projectId=12310799&version=12319867[refer
to JIRA]

Another new thing this release brings is a change in versioning: we've
aligned to JBoss' release versioning pattern. So the name is now Alpha3
vs ALPHA3(as per the old naming pattern). More about the reason for
doing that in this
http://infinispan.blogspot.co.uk/2012/08/infinispan-project-versioning-change.html[blog
post].
