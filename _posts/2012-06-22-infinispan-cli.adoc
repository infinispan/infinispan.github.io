When using Infinispan, both embedded as a library in an application or
as a standalone server, I always longed for a simple standalone tool for
interacting with the caches and the data within them. As all itches go,
I had to scratch it, and so I present you with Infinispan's own CLI !

The CLI allows you to inspect and modify the data within an Infinispan
cache and also provides access to some of the more advanced features
(such as transactions).

The CLI is built out of two elements: a server-side module and the
client command tool. The server-side module is optional, and provides
the actual interpreter for the commands. Currently the server (and the
client) use the JMX protocol to communicate, but in a future release we
plan to support other communication protocols (in particular our own
HotRod).

To get started, you need at least Infinispan 5.2.0.ALPHA1. Unzip the
distribution and start a server:


./bin/startServer.sh -r hotrod


The startServer.sh script automatically enables remote JMX connections
and you can discover the port by running the jps command (part of the
JDK/JRE) as follows:


jps -v


which should display something like


26532 Jps -Dapplication.home=/usr/lib/jvm/jdk1.7.0_04 -Xms8m
20508 Main -Djava.net.preferIPv4Stack=true
-Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.ssl=false
-Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.authenticate=false
-Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.port=50434 -Dsun.nio.ch.bugLevel=""
-Dlog4j.configuration=file:////home/tst/Downloads/infinispan-5.2.0-SNAPSHOT/etc/log4j.xml


Now we can connect to the Infinispan instance using the CLI as
follows:


./bin/ispn-cli.sh -c jmx://localhost:50434


You will be presented with a prompt:


[jmx://localhost:50434]MyCacheManager>


The above prompt shows which host we're currently connected to and which
CacheManager is being used (in this case: MyCacheManager).

Let's try putting some data in the cache


put a a


Now let's check that the cache actually contains the entry we've just
put


get a


Which will display a glorious


a


The CLI understands several commands. Just type

help

to get a list of them and then

help [commandname]

to get help on a specific command's syntax.

The CLI uses the wonderful
https://github.com/stalep/jreadline[JReadline], so it supports all sorts
of fancy buffer editing, history navigation and tab-completion as if you
were in your comfortable OS shell (sorry Windows, cmd is not exactly a
modern shell).

An important aspect of an Infinispan cache is that you can store
whatever data you want in it. The CLI tries to interpret the data from
the input you give it. It understands most of the Java native types
(int, long, float, double, boolean, String), some additional fancy types
(such as UUIDs) and a JSON syntax for mapping any type of Java class, so
that you can write:

put user1 \{ "package.MyClass": \{"i": 5, "x": null, "b": true } };

Conversely, when performing a get, the interpreter will output a JSON
representation of your classes.

The CLI is still work in progress and will evolve and mature during
Infinispan's 5.2 development cycle. You are all welcome to try it out
and provide feedback on the
https://community.jboss.org/en/infinispan?view=discussions[forums], on
IRC on channel #infinispan and using our
https://issues.jboss.org/browse/ISPN[issue tracker] to report bugs and
ask for enhancements.

I will soon be blogging again, hopefully with a video which will
illustrate some of the more fanciful features of the CLI. Enjoy.
