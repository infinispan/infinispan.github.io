Infinispan 9 is the culmination of nearly a year of work. It is
codenamed "Ruppaner" in honor of the city of Konstanz, where we designed
many of the improvements we've made. Prost!


== Performance


We decided it was time to revisit Infinispan's performance and
scalability. So we went back to our internals design and we made a
number of improvements. Infinispan 9.0 is faster than any previous
release by quite a sizeable margin in a number of key aspects:


* distributed writes, thanks to a new algorithm which reduces the number
of RPCs required to write to the owners
* distributed reads, which scale much better under load
* replicated writes, also with better scalability under load
* eviction, thanks to a new in-memory container
* internal marshalling, which was completely rewritten


We will have a post dedicated to benchmarks detailing the difference
against previous versions and in various scenarios.


== Marshalling


We've made several improvements in the cluster and persistent storage
marshalling layer which has resulted in increased performance and
smaller payloads. Also, the new marshaller layer makes JBoss Marshalling
an optional component, which is only used when no Infinispan
Externalizers (or AdvancedExternalizers) are available for a given type,
hence relying on standard JDK Serializable/Externalizable capabilities
to be marshalled.


== Remote Hot Rod Clients


We now ship alternate marshallers for remote clients based on Kryo and
ProtoStuff.

Additionally, the Hot Rod protocol now supports streaming operations for
dealing with large objects.


== Off-Heap and data-container changes


An In-Memory Data Grid likes to eat through your memory (because you
want it to be fast!), but in the world of the JVM that is not ideal:
that huge chunk of data gives Garbage Collectors a hard time when the
heap goes into double-digit gigabyte territory. Long GC pauses can make
individual nodes unresponsive, compromising the stability of your
cluster.

Infinispan 9 introduces an improved data container which can optionally
store entries off-heap.

Additionally, our bounded container has been replaced with Ben Manes'
excellent Caffeine which provides much better performance. Check out
Ben's benchmarks where he compares, among other things, against
Infinispan's old bounded container.

Configuration-wise, the previously separate concepts of eviction,
store-as-binary and data-container have been merged into a single
'memory' configuration element.


== Persistence


The JDBC cache store received quite an overhaul:


* The internal connection pool is now based on HikariCP, for improved
performance
* Writes will now use database-specific upsert functionality when
available
* Transactional writes to the cache translate to transactional writes to
the database
* The JdbcBinaryStore and JdbcMixedStore have been removed as detailed
here


We have also replaced the LevelDB cache store with the better-maintained
and faster RocksDB cache store.


== Ickle, our new query language


We decided it was time for Infinispan to have a proper query language,
which would take full advantage of our query capabilities. We have
therefore grafted Lucene's full-text operators on top of a subset of
JP-QL to obtain Ickle. We have already started describing Ickle in a
recent blog post. For a taste of Ickle, the following query shows how to
combine a traditional boolean clause with a full-text term query:


select transactionId, amount, description from com.acme.Transaction
where amount > 10 and description : "coffee"


== Cloud integrations


Infinispan continues to play nicely in cloud environments thanks to a
number of improvements that have been made to discovery (such as
KUBE_PING for Kubernetes/OpenShift), health probes and our pre-built
Docker images.


== Multi-tenant server and SNI support


Infinispan Server is now capable of exposing multiple cache containers
through a single Hot Rod or REST endpoint. The selection of the
container is performed via SNI. This allows you to have a single cluster
serve all your applications while maintaining each one's data
isolated.


== Administration Console


The adminstration console has been completely rewritten in a more
modular fashion using TypeScript to allow for greater extensibility and
ease of maintanence. In addition to this refactor, the console now
supports the following:


* Stateless views
* HTTP Digest Authentication
* Management of individual and clustered Standalone server instances
* Internet Explorer



== Documentation overhaul


Our http://infinispan.org/docs/stable/index.html[documentation] has been
completely overhauled with entire chapters being added or rewritten for
readability and consistency.


== What's coming


We will be blogging in more detail about some of the things above, so
watch out for more content coming soon !


We've already started working on Infinispan 9.1 which will bring a
number of new features and improvements, such as clustered counters,
consistency checker with merge policies, a new distributed cache for
even better write performance, and more.
