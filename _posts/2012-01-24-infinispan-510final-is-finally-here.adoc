After over 4 months of development, testing, profiling...etc, I'm
extremely pleased to announce that Infinispan 5.1.0.FINAL 'Brahma' is
out now! It comes with some very important brand new features such as:

This has been a huge effort by all the Infinispan community including
forum users, which have been giving us tremendous feedback, occasional
community contributors and core developers. Thank you very much for all
the effort you've put in!!

5.1.0.FINAL, so make sure you
