Hi,
 
The Alpha3 release of Infinispan 7.0.0 is now available.

Highlights:


* authorization at both CacheManager and Cache levels
* some important enhancements for Map/Reduce's usability, like the
ability to use an intermediate cache during Map/Reduce execution and for
storing the final results of the Map/Reduce tasks
* a much welcomed revamp of the Infinispan embedded configuration which
has been aligned to with the server
