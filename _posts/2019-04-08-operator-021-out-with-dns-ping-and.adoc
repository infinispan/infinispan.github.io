We've just completed the release of the Infinispan Operator version
0.2.1. In this second minor release, we've added the following
features:


==== DNS Cluster Discovery


Cluster nodes now discover each other using DNS ping,Â which uses name
lookups. Each node publishes a headless service which they use to locate
each other. Previously, Kubernetes APIs were queried to discover other
nodes, but this required administrator rights. DNS ping does not require
admin permissions.


==== Configurable Image


The Infinispan server image used by the operator is now configurable,
e.g.

==== Configurable XML


You can now provide their own custom Infinispan server XML referencing
an existing ConfigMap:


Note that this example requires a ConfigMap with the XML file to be
created before hand.


==== Next Steps


We're already working on version 0.3.0, and in parallel we've been
working on our first OperatorHub submission. We hope to have some news
for you very soon :)

Cheers,
Galder
