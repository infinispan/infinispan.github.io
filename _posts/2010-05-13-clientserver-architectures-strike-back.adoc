I’m delighted to announce the release of
[#SPELLING_ERROR_0 .blsp-spelling-error]#Infinispan# 4.1.0.BETA1. For
this, our first beta release of the 4.1 series,
we’[#SPELLING_ERROR_1 .blsp-spelling-error]#ve# finished
http://community.jboss.org/docs/DOC-14421[Hot Rod] and
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memcached[[#SPELLING_ERROR_2 .blsp-spelling-error]#Memcached#
protocol] based http://community.jboss.org/docs/DOC-14644[server
implementations] and a
http://community.jboss.org/docs/DOC-15093[Java-based Hot Rod client] has
been developed as a reference implementation. Starting with 4.1.0.BETA1
as well, thanks to help of Tom
[#SPELLING_ERROR_3 .blsp-spelling-error]#Fenelly#,
[#SPELLING_ERROR_4 .blsp-spelling-error]#Infinispan# caches can be
exposed over a
http://community.jboss.org/docs/DOC-15184[[#SPELLING_ERROR_5 .blsp-spelling-error]#WebSocket#
interface via a very simple Javascript “Cache”
[#SPELLING_ERROR_6 .blsp-spelling-error]#API#].

A detailed
https://jira.jboss.org/jira/secure/ConfigureReport.jspa?versions=12313465&sections=.1.7.2.4.10.9.8.3.12.11.5&style=none&selectedProjectId=12310799&reportKey=pl.net.mamut:releasenotes&Next=Next[change
log] is available and the release is
[#SPELLING_ERROR_7 .blsp-spelling-error]#downloadable# from the
http://www.jboss.org/infinispan/downloads[usual place].

For the rest of the blog post, we’d like to share some of the objectives
of [#SPELLING_ERROR_8 .blsp-spelling-error]#Infinispan# 4.1 with the
community. Here at ‘[#SPELLING_ERROR_9 .blsp-spelling-error]#chez#
[#SPELLING_ERROR_10 .blsp-spelling-error]#Infinispan#’
we’[#SPELLING_ERROR_11 .blsp-spelling-error]#ve# been repeating the same
story over and over again:
http://www.parleys.com/#sl=1&st=5&id=1589[‘Memory is the new Disk, Disk
is the new Tape’] and this release is yet another step to educate the
community on this fact.
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Client%E2%80%93server_model[Client/Server
architectures] based around
[#SPELLING_ERROR_12 .blsp-spelling-error]#Infinispan# data grids are key
to enabling this reality but in case you might be wondering, why would
someone use [#SPELLING_ERROR_13 .blsp-spelling-error]#Infinispan# in a
client/server mode compared to using it as
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer_to_peer[peer-to-peer (p2p)] mode? How
does the client/server architecture enable memory to become the new
disk?

Broadly speaking, there three areas where a
[#SPELLING_ERROR_14 .blsp-spelling-error]#Infinispan# client/server
architecture might be chosen over p2p one:



*1. Access to [#SPELLING_ERROR_15 .blsp-spelling-error]#Infinispan# from
a non-[#SPELLING_ERROR_16 .blsp-spelling-error]#JVM# environment*


[#SPELLING_ERROR_17 .blsp-spelling-error]#Infinispan#’s roots can be
traced back to [#SPELLING_ERROR_18 .blsp-spelling-error]#JBoss# Cache, a
caching library developed to provide
J2[#SPELLING_ERROR_19 .blsp-spelling-error]#EE# application servers with
data replication. As such, the primary way of accessing
[#SPELLING_ERROR_20 .blsp-spelling-error]#Infinispan# or
[#SPELLING_ERROR_21 .blsp-spelling-error]#JBoss# Cache has always been
via direct calls coming from the same
[#SPELLING_ERROR_22 .blsp-spelling-error]#JVM#. However, as we have
repeated it before,
[#SPELLING_ERROR_23 .blsp-spelling-error]#Infinispan#’s goal is to
provide much more than that, it aims to provide data grid access to any
software application that you can think of and this obviously requires
[#SPELLING_ERROR_24 .blsp-spelling-error]#Infinispan# to enable access
from non-Java environments.

[#SPELLING_ERROR_25 .blsp-spelling-error]#Infinispan# comes with a
series of server modules that enable that precisely. All you have to do
is decide which [#SPELLING_ERROR_26 .blsp-spelling-error]#API# suits
your environment best. Do you want to enable access direct access to
[#SPELLING_ERROR_27 .blsp-spelling-error]#Infinispan# via HTTP? Just use
our http://community.jboss.org/docs/DOC-14095[REST] or
http://community.jboss.org/docs/DOC-15184[[#SPELLING_ERROR_28 .blsp-spelling-error]#WebSocket#]
modules. Or is it the case that you’re looking to expand the
capabilities of your
[#SPELLING_ERROR_29 .blsp-spelling-error]#Memcached# based applications?
Start an
http://community.jboss.org/docs/DOC-14644[[#SPELLING_ERROR_30 .blsp-spelling-error]#Infinispan#-backed
[#SPELLING_ERROR_31 .blsp-spelling-error]#Memcached# server] and your
existing [#SPELLING_ERROR_32 .blsp-spelling-error]#Memcached# clients
will be able to talk to it immediately. Or maybe even you’re interested
in http://community.jboss.org/docs/DOC-15093[accessing
[#SPELLING_ERROR_33 .blsp-spelling-error]#Infinispan# via Hot Rod, our
new, highly efficient binary protocol which supports smart-clients]?
Then, gives us a hand developing non-Java clients that can talk the Hot
Rod protocol! :).

*2. [#SPELLING_ERROR_34 .blsp-spelling-error]#Infinispan# as a dedicated
data tier*

Quite often applications running running a p2p environment have caching
requirements larger than the heap size in which case it makes a lot of
sense to separate caching into a separate dedicated tier.

It’s also very common to find businesses with varying work loads
overtime where there’s a need to start business processing servers to
deal with increased load, or stop them when work load is reduced to
lower power consumption. When
[#SPELLING_ERROR_35 .blsp-spelling-error]#Infinispan# data grid
instances are deployed
[#SPELLING_ERROR_36 .blsp-spelling-corrected]#alongside# business
processing servers, starting/stopping these can be a slow process due to
state transfer, or rehashing, particularly when large data sets are
used. Separating [#SPELLING_ERROR_37 .blsp-spelling-error]#Infinispan#
into a dedicated tier provides faster and more predictable server
start/stop procedures – ideal for modern
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing[cloud-based deployments]
where elasticity in your application tier is important.

It’s common knowledge that optimizations for large memory usage systems
compared to optimizations for CPU intensive systems are very different.
If you mix both your data grid and business logic under the same roof,
finding a balanced set of optimizations that keeps both sides happy is
difficult. Once again, separating the data and business tiers can
alleviate this problem.

You might be wondering that if
[#SPELLING_ERROR_38 .blsp-spelling-error]#Infinispan# is moved to a
separate tier, access to data now requires a network call and hence will
hurt your performance in terms of time per call. However, separating
tiers gives you a much more scalable architecture and your data is never
more than 1 network call away. Even if the dedicated
[#SPELLING_ERROR_39 .blsp-spelling-error]#Infinispan# data grid is
configured with distribution,
http://community.jboss.org/docs/DOC-15093[a Hot Rod smart-client
implementation] - such as the Java reference implementation shipped with
[#SPELLING_ERROR_40 .blsp-spelling-error]#Infinispan# 4.1.0.BETA1 - can
determine where a particular key is located and hit a server that
contains it directly.

*3. Data-as-a-Service
([#SPELLING_ERROR_41 .blsp-spelling-error]#DaaS#)*

Increasingly, we see scenarios where environments host a multitude of
applications that share the need for data storage, for example in
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platform_as_a_service[[#SPELLING_ERROR_42 .blsp-spelling-error]#Plattform#-as-a-Service
([#SPELLING_ERROR_43 .blsp-spelling-error]#PaaS#)] cloud-style
environments (whether public or internal). In such configurations, you
don’t want to be launching a data grid per each application since it’d
be a nightmare to maintain – not to mention
[#SPELLING_ERROR_44 .blsp-spelling-corrected]#resource#-wasteful.
Instead you want deployments or applications to start processing as soon
as possible. In these cases, it’d make a lot of sense to keep a pool of
[#SPELLING_ERROR_45 .blsp-spelling-error]#Infinispan# data grid nodes
acting as a shared storage tier. Isolated cache access could easily
achieved by making sure each application uses a different cache name
(i.e. the application name could be used as cache name). This can easily
achieved with protocols such as
http://community.jboss.org/docs/DOC-14421[Hot Rod] where each operation
requires a cache name to be provided.

Regardless of the scenarios explained above, there’re some common
benefits to separating an
[#SPELLING_ERROR_46 .blsp-spelling-error]#Infinispan# data grid from the
business logic that accesses it. In fact, these are very similar to the
benefits achieved when application servers and databases don’t run under
the same roof. By separating the layers, you can manage each layer
independently, which means that adding/removing nodes, maintenance,
upgrades...etc can be handled independently. In other words, if you
wanna upgrade your application server or
[#SPELLING_ERROR_47 .blsp-spelling-error]#servlet# container, you don’t
need to bring down your data layer.

All of this is available to you now, but the story does not end here.
Bearing in mind that these client/server modules are based around
reliable
[#SPELLING_ERROR_48 .blsp-spelling-error]#TCP#/[#SPELLING_ERROR_49 .blsp-spelling-error]#IP#,
using http://www.jboss.org/netty[Netty, the fast and reliable
[#SPELLING_ERROR_50 .blsp-spelling-error]#NIO# library], they could also
in the future form the base of new functionality. For example,
client/server modules could be linked together to connect geographically
separated [#SPELLING_ERROR_51 .blsp-spelling-error]#Infinispan# data
grids and enable different disaster recovery strategies.

So, http://www.jboss.org/infinispan/downloads[download
[#SPELLING_ERROR_52 .blsp-spelling-error]#Infinispan# 4.1.0.BETA1 right
[#SPELLING_ERROR_53 .blsp-spelling-error]#awa#]y, give a try to these
new modules and
http://community.jboss.org/en/infinispan?view=discussions[let us know
your thoughts].



Finally, don't forget that we'll be talking about Hot Rod in Boston at
the end of June for the first ever
http://www.jboss.org/events/JUDCon.html[[#SPELLING_ERROR_54 .blsp-spelling-error]#JUDCon#].
Don't miss out!
