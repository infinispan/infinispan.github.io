https://hub.docker.com/r/jboss/infinispan-operator[Infinispan Operator]
is a new method of packaging, deploying and managing Infinispan clusters
on OpenShift. You can think of the Infinispan Operator as the runtime
that manages Infinispan clusters on OpenShift.

We've just done our first Infinispan Operator pre-release, version
0.1.0, which allows you to easily boot up an Infinispan cluster on
OpenShift.

Using the operator is as simple as installing the Infinispan Operator
(requires admin access) on OpenShift, and then create a YAML descriptor
that defines the Infinispan cluster. The example below shows how to
create a 3-node Infinispan cluster:


And then call:

$ oc apply -f example-infinispan.yaml

A more detailed tutorial on using the Infinispan Operator can be found
https://github.com/infinispan/infinispan-simple-tutorials/tree/master/operator[here].
We highly recommend you give it a go and let us know what you think.

Over the next few versions we'll be adding more features that make the
most of the capabilities the
https://coreos.com/blog/introducing-operator-framework[Operator
framework] offers to automatically manage the health and status of
running Infinispan clusters.

Please also note that as we work towards the 1.0 release, some things
might change :)

Cheers
Galder
