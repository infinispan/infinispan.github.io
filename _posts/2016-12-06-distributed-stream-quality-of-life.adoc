As I hope most people reading this already know, since Infinispan 8 you
can utilize the entire Java 8 Stream API and have it be distributed
across your cluster.  This performs the various intermediate and
terminal operations on the data local to the node it lives on, providing
for extreme performance.  There are some limitations and things to know
as was explained at
http://blog.infinispan.org/2015/09/distributed-streams.html[distributed-streams].

The problem with the API up to now was that, if you wanted to use
lambdas, it was quite an ugly scene.  Take for example the following
code snippet:

However, for Infinispan 9 we utilize a little syntax feature added with
Java 8
[https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se8/html/jls-15.html#jls-15.12.2.5[1]]
to add some much needed quality of life improvements.  This allows the
most specific interface to be chosen when a method is overloaded.  This
allows for a neat interaction when we add some new interfaces that
implement Serializable and the various function interfaces
(SerializableFunction, SerializablePredicate, SerializableSupplier,
etc).  All of the Stream methods have been overridden on the
https://docs.jboss.org/infinispan/9.0/apidocs/org/infinispan/CacheStream.html[CacheStream]
interface to take these arguments.

This allows for the code to be much cleaner as we can see here:

== 9.0 Distributed Streams Example

Extra Methods

This is not the only benefit of providing the *CacheStream* interface:
we can also provide new methods that aren't available on the standard
https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/?java/util/stream/Stream.html[Stream]
interface.  One example is the
https://docs.jboss.org/infinispan/9.0/apidocs/org/infinispan/CacheStream.html#forEach-org.infinispan.util.function.SerializableBiConsumer-[forEach]
method which allows the user to more easily provide a Cache that is
injected on each node as required.  This way you don't have to use the
clumsy
https://docs.jboss.org/infinispan/9.0/apidocs/org/infinispan/stream/CacheAware.html[CacheAware]
interface and can directly use lambdas as desired.

Here is an example of the new *forEach* method in action:


In this example we take a cache and, based on the keys in it, write
those values into another cache. Since *forEach* doesn't have to be side
effect free, you can do whatever you want inside here.

All in all these improvements should make using Distributed Streams with
Infinispan much easier.  The extra methods could be extended further if
users have use cases they would love to suggest.  Just let us know, and
I hope you enjoy using Infinispan!
