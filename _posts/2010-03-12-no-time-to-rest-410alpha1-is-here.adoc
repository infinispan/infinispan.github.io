"Release quick, release often", that's one of our mottos at Infinispan.
Barely a couple of weeks after
http://infinispan.blogspot.com/2010/02/infinispan-400final-has-landed.html[releasing
Infinispan 4.0.0.Final], here comes
http://www.jboss.org/infinispan/downloads[4.1.0.Alpha1] with new
goodies. The main star for this release is the new server module
implementing
http://github.com/trondn/memcached/blob/master/doc/protocol.txt[Memcached's
text protocol].

This new module enables you to use Infinispan as a replacement for any
of your http://memcached.org/[Memcached servers] with the added bonus
that Infinispan's Memcached server module allows you to start several
instances forming a cluster so that they
http://community.jboss.org/docs/DOC-14853#replicated[replicate],
http://community.jboss.org/docs/DOC-14853#replicated[invalidate] or
http://community.jboss.org/docs/DOC-14853#distribution[distribute] data
between these instances, a feature not present in
http://memcached.org/[default Memcached implementation].

On top of the clustering capabilities Infinispan memcached server module
gets in-built http://community.jboss.org/docs/DOC-14873[eviction],
http://community.jboss.org/docs/DOC-14893[cache store support],
http://community.jboss.org/docs/DOC-14865[JMX/Jopr monitoring] etc...
for free.

To get started, first
http://www.jboss.org/infinispan/downloads.html[download Infinispan
4.1.0.Alpha1]. Then, go to
http://community.jboss.org/docs/DOC-14644["Using Infinispan Memcached
Server" wiki] and follow the instructions there. If you're interested in
finding out how to set up multiple Infinispan memcached servers in a
cluster, head to http://community.jboss.org/docs/DOC-14773["Talking To
Infinispan Memcached Servers From Non-Java Clients" wiki] where you'll
also find out how to access our Memcached implementation from non-Java
clients.

Finally, you can find the API docs for 4.1.0.Alpha 1
http://infinispan.sourceforge.net/documentation/4.1/apidocs/[here] and
note that this is an unstable release that is meant to gather feedback
on the Memcached server module as early as possible.

Cheers,
Galder
