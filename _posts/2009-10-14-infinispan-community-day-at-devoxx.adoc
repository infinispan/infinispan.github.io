We're hosting an Infinispan community day in Antwerp in November, just
after http://www.devoxx.com/display/DV09/Home[Devoxx 2009]. This will be
on Friday, just after the main conference finishes. Expect core
Infinispan committers to be around, running demos and answering specific
questions. Buy a beer, get a question answered. :-) This session will
also be co-hosted alongside the
http://in.relation.to/Bloggers/SeamTeamDevoxx[SEAM community] session,
so you get 2 interesting techs in one go! The venue is _TBD_ but I will
post more details on this shortly. It will be close enough to the main
conference venue though.



This is a free event, but http://tinyurl.com/devoxxresponseform[please
register] so we can keep track of numbers.



And FYI, I will be speaking at the conference on
http://www.devoxx.com/display/DV09/Infinispan+and+the+future+of+data+grids[Infinispan
and the future of data grids] - I do hope to see you there!



Cheers

Manik
