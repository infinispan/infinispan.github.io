Dear Infinispan community,

In the spirit of "release early, release often" we are proud to announce
the Infinispan 7.1.0CR2 release. We skipped CR1 as our Nexus repository
experienced transient issues after we published the artifacts.

CR2 is mostly a maintenance release. Beta1 brought us a lot of major
improvements that we further ironed out in CR2 release. There are a few
component upgrades and a new feature worth mentioning - exposing cluster
and node based statistics to DMR. 

Feel free to join us and shape the future releases on
our http://www.jboss.org/infinispan/forums[forums],
our https://lists.jboss.org/mailman/listinfo/infinispan-dev[mailing
lists] or
our http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=%23infinispan[#infinispan] IRC
channel.
