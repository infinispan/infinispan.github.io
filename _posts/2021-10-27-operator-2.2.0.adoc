We're pleased to announce
https://operatorhub.io/operator/infinispan[version 2.2.0.Final of the Infinispan Operator]
for Kubernetes and Red Hat OpenShift.

This is the first Operator release based on Infinispan 13.

Release highlights:

    - Custom server configuration. Add custom configuration for Infinispan Server using ConfigMap objects.
    - Configurable number of relay nodes for cross-site replication. Relay nodes send and receive replication requests from backup locations. You can now increase the number of relay nodes with the `sites.local.maxRelayNodes` field to achieve a better distribution of cross-site replication requests.
    - TLS security for cross-site replication traffic. You can now encrypt cross-site connections between Infinispan clusters with TLS by adding keystore secrets and configuring the `sites.local.encryption` field.
    - Operator SDK upgraded to v1.3.2
