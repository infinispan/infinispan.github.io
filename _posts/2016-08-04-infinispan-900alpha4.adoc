Dear Infinispan users,

I am glad to announce that we have released 9.0.0.Alpha4 for you!


A brand new Alpha release from our development branch: 9.0.0.Alpha4 has
a slew of bug fixes, and some more enhancements, among which we single
out: transactional JDBC cache store and Kubernetes PING support.Â  We
also have added quite a bit of documentation around querying to help
users better understand how to use it.

http://infinispan.org/download/[Download] it now, try it and tell us
what you think on the infinispan

meet us on IRC: channel #infinispan on Freenode.
