In recent years Software as a Service concept has gained a lot of
traction. I'm pretty sure you've used it many times before. Let's take a
look at a practical example and explain what's going on behind the
scenes.

===== Practical example - photo album application

Imagine a very simple photo album application hosted within the cloud.
Upon the first usage you are asked to create an account. Once you sign
up, a new tenant is created for you in the application with all
necessary details and some dedicated storage just for you. Starting from
this point you can start using the album - download and upload photos. 



The software provider that created the photo album application can also
celebrate. They have a new client! But with a new client the system
needs to increase its capacity to ensure it can store all those lovely
photos. There are also other concerns - how to prevent leaking photos
and other data from one account into another? And finally, since all the
content will be transferred through the Internet, how to secure
transmission?



As you can see, multi-tenancy is not that easy as it would seem. The
good news is that if it's properly configured and secured, it might be
beneficial both for the client and for the software provider. 

===== Multi-tenancy in Infinispan

Let's think again about our photo album application for a moment.
Whenever a new client signs up we need to create a new account for him
and dedicate some storage. Translating that into Infinispan concepts
this would mean creating a new
https://docs.jboss.org/infinispan/9.1/apidocs/org/infinispan/manager/CacheContainer.html[CacheContainer].
Within a CacheContainer we can create multiple Caches for user details,
metadata and photos. You might be wondering why creating a new
https://docs.jboss.org/infinispan/9.1/apidocs/org/infinispan/Cache.html[Cache]
is not sufficient? It turns out that when a Hot Rod client connects to a
cluster, it connects to a CacheContainer exposed via a Hot Rod Endpoint.
Such a client has access to all Caches. Considering our example, your
friends could possibly see your photos. That's definitely not good! So
we need to create a CacheContainer per tenant. Before we introduced
Multi-tenancy, you could expose each CacheContainer using a separate
port (using separate Hot Rod Endpoint for each of them). In many
scenarios this is impractical because of proliferation of ports. For
this reason we introduced the Router concept. It allows multiple clients
to access their own CacheContainers through a single endpoint and also
prevents them from accessing data which doesn't belong to them. The
final piece of the puzzle is transmitting sensitive data through an
unsecured channel such as the Internet. The use of TLS encryption solves
this problem. The final outcome should look like the following:



https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-9gJn1KCZK1Y/WUjMfn5VKXI/AAAAAAAAJrg/m6QfOjXjpPU6mfAsvn3kGnt5YYFOas1iQCLcBGAs/s1600/multiple-data-containers-and-router.png[image:https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-9gJn1KCZK1Y/WUjMfn5VKXI/AAAAAAAAJrg/m6QfOjXjpPU6mfAsvn3kGnt5YYFOas1iQCLcBGAs/s320/multiple-data-containers-and-router.png[image,width=320,height=170]]



The Router component on the diagram above is responsible for recognizing
data from each client and redirecting it to the appropriate Hot Rod
endpoint.
As the name implies, the router inspects incoming traffic and reroutes
it to the appropriate underlying CacheContainer. To do this it can use
two different strategies depending on the protocol:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_Name_Indication[TLS/SNI] for the
Hot Rod protocol, matching each server certificate to a specific cache
container  and path prefixes for REST.
The SNI strategy detects the SNI Host Name (which is used as tenant) and
also requires TLS certificates to match. By creating proper trust stores
we can match which tenant can access which CacheContainers.
URL path prefix is very easy to understand, but it is also less secure
unless you enable authentication. For this reason it should not be used
in production unless you know what you are doing (the SNI strategy for
the REST endpoint will be implemented in the near future). Each client
has its own unique REST path prefix that needs to be used for accessing
the data (e.g. _http://127.0.0.1:8080/rest/*client1*/fotos/2_).



Confused? Let's clarify this with an example.

===== Foto application sample configuration

The first step is to generate proper key/trust stores for the server and
client:





The next step is to configure the server. The snippet below shows only
the most important parts:





Let's analyze the most critical lines:

* 7, 15 - We need to add generated key stores to the server identities
* 25, 30 - It is highly recommended to use separate CacheContainers
* 38, 39 - A Hot Rod connector (but without socket binding) is required
to provide proper mapping to CacheContainer. You can also use many
useful settings on this level (like ignored caches or authentication).
* 42 - Router definition which binds into default Hot Rod and REST
ports.
* 44 - 46 - The most important bit which states that only a client using
_SSLRealm1_ (which uses trust store corresponding
to _client_1_server_keystore.jks_) and TLS/SNI Host name _client-1_ can
access Hot Rod endpoint named _multi-tenant-hotrod-1_ (which points to
CacheContainer _multi-tenancy-1_).

===== Improving the application by using OpenShift

_Hint: You might be interested in looking at our previous blog posts
about hosting Infinispan on OpenShift. You may find them at the bottom
of the page._



So far we've learned how to create and configure a new CacheContainer
per tenant. But we also need to remember that system capacity needs to
be increased with each new tenant. OpenShift is a perfect tool for
scaling the system up and down. The configuration we created in the
previous step almost matches our needs but needs some tuning.



As we mentioned earlier, we need to encrypt transport between the client
and the server. The main disadvantage is that OpenShift Router will not
be able to inspect it and take routing decisions. A
https://docs.openshift.org/latest/architecture/core_concepts/routes.html#secured-routes[passthrough
Route] fits perfectly in this scenario but requires creating TLS/SNI
Host Names as Fully Qualified Application Names. So if you start
OpenShift locally (using _oc cluster up_) the tenant names will look
like the following: _client-1-fotoalbum.192.168.0.17.nip.io_. 



We also need to think how to store generated key stores. The easiest way
is to use
https://docs.openshift.org/latest/dev_guide/secrets.html[Secrets]:





Finally, a full DeploymentConfiguration:







If you're interested in playing with the demo by yourself, you might
find a working example
https://github.com/infinispan-demos/infinispan-openshift-multitenancy[here].
It mainly targets OpenShift but the concept and configuration are also
applicable for local deployment.
