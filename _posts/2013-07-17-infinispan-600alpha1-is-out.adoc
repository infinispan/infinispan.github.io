Dear Infinispan community,

We're proud to announce the first Alpha release of Infinispan 6.0.0.
Starting with this release, Infinispan license is moving to the terms of
the http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0[Apache Software Licence
version 2.0].

Besides increased stability (about 30 bug fixes) this release also
brings several new features:


* A more efficient FileCacheStore implementation (courtesy Karsten
Blees)
* A new set of usage and performance statistics developed within the
scope of the CloudTM project
* A new (experimental) marshaller for Hot Rod based on
http://code.google.com/p/protobuf/[protobuf], which will be primarily
used by the upcoming remote querying feature. Since this has reuse
potential in other projects it was promoted to an independent project
named https://github.com/infinispan/protostream[_protostream_] under the
Infinispan umbrella

For a complete list of features and fixes included in this release
please refer to the
https://issues.jboss.org/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?projectId=12310799&version=12320762[release
notes].
