For those who can't wait to get hold on the newest Infinispan features,
we've just released the third alpha release of the 5.0 series, called
5.0.0.ALPHA3.



Apart from including fixes in
https://issues.jboss.org/secure/ConfigureReport.jspa?atl_token=c0ee1b92ed270815b460be3704d78af9ead2f994&versions=12316042&sections=all&style=none&selectedProjectId=12310799&reportKey=org.jboss.labs.jira.plugin.release-notes-report-plugin:releasenotes&Next=Next[4.2.1.CR2],
it allows users to prefetch data in advance in parallel thanks to the
new getAsync() method. Why is this useful? Imagine the following
scenario: A cache is configured with distribution and an app that
requires values associated with k1, k2, and k3 in order to do its job.
In the worst case scenario assume that all these keys located in remote
nodes. Previously, before 5.0.0.ALPHA3, you'd have written something
like this:



[source,java]
----
Value v1 = cache.get("k1");
Value v2 = cache.get("k2");
Value v3 = cache.get("k3");
----



The problem with this code is that each get() is sequential, so the
second get() call must wait for first get() to retrieve data from the
remote node before it can execute. This is clearly not very optimal.
From 5.0.0.ALPHA3 onwards, you can do this instead:



[source,java]
----
NotifyingFuture<Value> f1 = cache.getAsync("k1");
NotifyingFuture<Value> f2 = cache.getAsync("k2");
NotifyingFuture<Value> f3 = cache.getAsync("k3");
...
Value v1 = f1.get(); // blocks until value has been returned
Value v2 = f2.get();
Value v3 = f3.get();
----



The clear advantage here is that the get requests, via getAsync(), can
be fired in parallel and they don't need to wait for each other.
Afterwards, when the value is needed, simply call get() on the future
received.



Amongst other API enhancements, such as
https://issues.jboss.org/browse/ISPN-900[RemoteCache implementing size()
and isEmpty()], or https://issues.jboss.org/browse/ISPN-906[the ability
to delete AtomicMap instances via AtomicMapLookup], it's worth
highlighting that we've taken
http://community.jboss.org/thread/161913[your feedback on board with
regards to how Infinispan is configured programmatically], and from
5.0.0.ALPHA3 onwards, we provide a more fluent way of configuring
Infinispan. For example:



[source,java]
----
GlobalConfiguration gc = new GlobalConfiguration();

GlobalJmxStatisticsConfig jmxStatistics = gc.configureGlobalJmxStatistics();
jmxStatistics.allowDuplicateDomains(true).enabled(true);

TransportConfig transport = gc.configureTransport();
transport.clusterName("blah").machineId("id").rackId("rack").strictPeerToPeer(true);
----



You can find more examples of this new configuration
https://github.com/infinispan/infinispan/blob/master/core/src/test/java/org/infinispan/config/ProgrammaticConfigurationTest.java[here].
Note that this fluent API is likely to evolve further before we go final
with 5.0.0 as shown in this
http://community.jboss.org/message/588125#588125[forum discussion], but
please keep your feedback coming! Finally, details of what's fixed is in
the
https://issues.jboss.org/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?projectId=12310799&version=12315984[release
notes]. As always, please use the
http://community.jboss.org/en/infinispan?view=discussions[user forums]
to report back, grab the release
http://www.jboss.org/infinispan/downloads[here], enjoy and keep the
feedback coming.



Cheers,
Galder
