Earlier this month I did an interview with the DevNation 2016 organizers
to talk about my talk on forthcoming talk on building reactive
applications with Node.js and JBoss Data Grid, the Infinispan version
for which Red Hat provides professional support, certified integration,
patches...etc.

The talk will be happen next Tuesday, 28th June at 3:30pm PDT, so if
you're in DevNation and want to find out more about Infinispan and our
new Node.js Javascript client, make sure you join us then!

==== Building reactive applications with Node.js and Red Hat JBoss Data Grid

JBoss Data Grid is a distributed in-memory key/value data store from Red
Hat, which can be used for caching, temporary and permanent storage.
Although Java developers were its primary audience initially, the team
has been expanding its appeal to C++, C# and even Javascript developers.

The latest JBoss Data Grid release includes a fully asynchronous Node.js
client for interacting with JBoss Data Grid servers and my talk at
DevNation is focused on how Javascript developers can make the most of
the client to cache or store their data.

The talk has been designed around a web application that promotes JBoss
Data Grid talks in forthcoming conferences, user groups… etc. The
application will contain a Node.js component whose job will be to
interact with the backend JBoss Data Grid servers to store and retrieve
data, as well as receiving events when new information has been added to
the backend. Through the live coding of this application, the audience
will get an understanding of how to interact with the newly released
Node.js JBoss Data Grid client, and after the talk they’ll have access
to the code to be able to try it themselves.

*About the presenter:*

This will be my first time speaking at DevNation and I’m really excited
about it because it brings together speaks and attendees not only from
the Java/JVM space, but from other important developer communities such
as Javascript.

Although I started as a Java developer, over the past decade I’ve become
more and more interested in other programming languages, in particular
functional programming languages such as Scala and Javascript, which
I’ve been able to apply directly at my job.

These days I’m hugely interested by the purely functional ones such as
Haskell, Elm or Purescript because the lack of mutability makes their
solutions both elegant and easier to reason about. I’m also keeping a
close eye as well on the Erlang ecosystem, e.g. Elixir, because I feel
that the predictable latency offered by the Erlang VM is something that
it’s not so easy to achieve in Java Virtual Machine.

I think learning other programming languages is one of the best things a
developer can do, because it opens your mind to different points of
view, different ways to solve problems, and widens the solution space.
