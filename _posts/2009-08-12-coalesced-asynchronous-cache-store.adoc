As we prepare for Infinispan's beta release, let me introduce to you one
of the recent enhancements implemented which improves the way the
current asynchronous (or write-behind) cache store works.

Right until now, the asynchronous cache store simply queued
modifications, while a set of threads would apply them. However, if the
queue contained N put operations on the same key, these threads would
apply each and every modification one after the other, which is not very
efficient.

Thanks to the excellent feedback from the Infinispan community, we've
now improved the asynchronous cache store so that it coalesces changes
and only applies the latest modification on a key. So, if N put
operations on the same key are queued, only the last modification will
be applied to the cache store.

Internally, the asynchronous concurrent queueing mechanism used performs
in O(1) by keeping an map with the latest values for each key. So, this
maps acts like the queue but there's a not a need for a queue as such,
we only care about making sure the latest values are stored hence, order
is not important.

Note that the way threads apply these modifications is that they start
working as soon as there are any changes available and so to see these
changes coalesced, the system needs to be relatively busy or a lot of
changes on the same key need to happen in a relatively short period of
time. We could have made these threads work periodically, i.e. every X
seconds, but by doing that, we would be letting modifications pile up
and the time between operations and the cache store updates would go up,
hence increasing the chance that the cache store is outdated.

Finally, there's no configuration modifications required to get the
asynchronous cache store to work in the coalesced way, it just works
like this out-of-the-box. Example:
