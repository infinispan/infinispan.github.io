It's that time of year again, and http://www.redhat.com/summit/[Red Hat
Summit/JBoss World 2011] looms ever larger on the horizon.  Back in
Boston again this year, it will be co-located with another
http://www.jboss.org/events/JUDCon[JUDCon], the JBoss Users and
Developers Conference.

*[.underline]#Red Hat Summit/JBoss World#*
Infinispan is well-represented again at Summit/JBW,
http://infinispan.blogspot.com/2010/04/boston-are-you-ready-for-infinispan.html[as
it was last year].  I will be
http://www.redhat.com/summit/sessions/jboss.html#606[speaking] on using
Infinispan to solve a number of scalability and availability issues,
including reducing database bottlenecks.

http://www.redhat.com/summit/speakers/session.html#ebernard[Emmanuel
Bernard] and
http://www.redhat.com/summit/speakers/session.html#sgrinovero[Sanne
Grinovero] will be speaking on
http://community.jboss.org/en/hibernate/ogm[Hibernate OGM] - an
awesomely cool project to provide JPA-like access to Infinispan (details
of the session
http://www.redhat.com/summit/sessions/jboss.html#83[available here]).

http://www.redhat.com/summit/speakers/session.html#cbomba[Craig Bomba]
and http://www.redhat.com/summit/speakers/session.html#sjohnson[Shane
Johnson] will talk about
http://www.redhat.com/summit/sessions/jboss.html#325[optimising
Infinispan for performance and consistency] based on lessons learned
using Infinispan at the http://www.cboe.com/[Chicago Board of Options
Exchange], the world's largest options exchange.

Further, for the first time, we intend to
http://www.redhat.com/summit/sessions/labs.html[run a hands-on lab] on
Infinispan, coordinated by
http://www.redhat.com/summit/speakers/session.html#jtyrrell[Jim
Tyrrell].  An awesome chance to learn about the practical aspects of
working with Infinispan, with core Infinispan engineers on hand to
answer questions, etc.  This sort of opportunity doesn't come about
every day!  :-)

*[.underline]#JUDCon#*
JUDCon attendees too will get their fill of your favourite data grid
with a talk titled
_http://www.jboss.org/events/JUDCon/agenda.html[Infinispan for Ninja
Developers]_ and one on Infinispan's new
http://infinispan.blogspot.com/2011/01/introducing-distributed-execution-and.html[Map/Reduce
capabilities].  Fun, hands-on, developer-focused deep dives.


*UPDATE:* I forgot to mention, Sanne Grinovero will also be
http://www.jboss.org/events/JUDCon/day2track2.html#230PM[talking about
advanced querying on Infinispan].  More cool stuff.
