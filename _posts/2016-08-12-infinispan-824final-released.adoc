Dear Infinispan community,

We are proud to announce a new micro release of our stable 8.2 branch.
Download it http://infinispan.org/download/[here] and try it out!

This maintenance release includes a handful of bug fixes and a bonus
https://issues.jboss.org/browse/ISPN-6922[new feature]. If you are using
any other 8.x release, we recommend to upgrade to 8.2.4.Final.

Check out the
https://issues.jboss.org/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?projectId=12310799&version=12330964[fixed
issues], download the release and tell us all about it on the
https://developer.jboss.org/en/infinispan/content[forum], on our
https://issues.jboss.org/projects/ISPN[issue tracker] or on IRC on the
#infinispan channel on
http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=%23infinispan[Freenode].

We are currently busy working on the upcoming beta release of the 9.0
stream.

Cheers,
The Infinispan team
