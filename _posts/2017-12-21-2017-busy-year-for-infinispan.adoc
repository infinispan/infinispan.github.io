It's been a very busy year from an Infinispan evangelisation
perspective, so before the year ends, we wanted to round up the
conferences and user groups that featured Infinispan related talks. This
is a good opportunity to catch up on what we've been showing in our
Infinispan outings:

===== Patterns d’utilisation de systèmes in memory

France]

This was our first outing of the year with Emmanuel and I showing the
audience at Devoxx France the different use cases for data grids. This
was also the first time we showed swiss train related demos which we'd
improve throughout the year. Slides can be found

Hat DevNation Live]

In this talk, I focused on the big data related use cases for
Infinispan. I showed how Infinispan could be used for near real-time
data processing using Continuous Querys, and how to analise data using
distributed Java Streams. Slides can be found
https://speakerdeck.com/galderz/big-data-in-action-with-infinispan[here]
and the demo

===== HACEP: Highly available and horizontally scalable complex event processing

by Ugo Landini, Sanne Grinovero, Andrea Leoncini, Andrea Tarocchi
@ Red Hat Summit

In this hands on lab, Ugo et al showed how to build a highly available
and scalable complex event processing engine with Red Hat JBoss BRMS and
and Red Hat JBoss Data Grid (the commercial supported version of
Infinispan). This workshop resulted in unmissable

On The Beach]



The aim of this talk is to demonstrate how Infinispan's Node.js client
could be combined with Elm and Infinispan server instances to build a
functional reactive application. The talk focused on how build a CRUD
application using Elm and Node.js technologies and using Infinispan
in-memory data grids for storing and querying information. Slides can be
found here:





===== Streaming Data Analysis with Kubernetes

by Galder Zamarreño

@ http://blog.infinispan.org/2017/10/thanks-basel-one-2017.html[Basel
One]



This talk is a spin off of the big data in action talk which focuses on
exploring in greater detail how streaming data can be analysed within a
Kubernetes orchestrated cluster. The demo can be
found https://github.com/infinispan-demos/streaming-data-kubernetes/tree/baselone-17[here] and

Java User Group]



This talk is a Spanish spin off the analytics part of the big data in
action talk. Not only did it showed how to use distributed Java Streams
to analyse data with Infinispan, but also demonstrated the capabilities
of Spark/Hadoop integrations. The demos can be
found https://github.com/infinispan-demos/swiss-transport-datagrid/blob/codemotion-madrid-17/live-events/madridjug17.md[here]
