Infinispan HotRod C# Client 7.0.0.Alpha1 is now available. This new
version is a C# wrapper over the native client and brings support for L2
and L3 client intelligence levels in addition to L1. As more features
are added to the native client they will make their way into the C#
client as well.

You can find the the .msi installer on the
http://infinispan.org/hotrod-clients/[download] page and the
https://github.com/infinispan/dotnet-client/[source code] on GitHub.
Please give it a try and let us know what you think.
