Finally I was able to complete my trip to Grenoble to speak at
http://www.alpesjug.fr/[Alpes JUG] on the 29th of March about all things
http://www.jboss.org/infinispan[Infinispan], and I must say that
I through fully enjoyed the experience. On arrival I was greeted by one
of my JBossian colleagues, Chris Laprun, who lives in Grenoble.

After spending a few hours hanging around, we headed for the location of
the Alpes JUG, where I met by http://ludopoitou.wordpress.com/[Ludovic
Poitou] and other members of the JUG. The talk involved me speaking for
2 hours giving an overall view of Infinispan, while developing a simple
application that would showcase Infinispan's capabilities. As always
with live demos, one or two things didn't go fully according to plan,
but overall the demo worked fine. For those who attended, remember that
the demo code can be found
https://github.com/infinispan/infinispan-labs[here].

After the talk I had the chance to meet the attendants of the JUG where
we discussed about caching, data grids, Hibernate 2nd level cache...etc.
Having had some pizza slices, Chris and I moved on to a pub in the old
part of Grenoble where we're able to watch my dear Athetic Bilbao crash
Shalke 04 in the Europa League :).

Next day Chris and I met with another of the Alpes JUG leaders,
called http://www.ehsavoie.com/[Emmanuel Hugonnet], with whom we had
some lunch. I must say that I felt in love with the local cuisine having
tried some local rather pinky sausage with cold lentils with mustard
(what a great combo!). Here's a pic:

It was a joy being invited to speak at Alpes JUG and I'd certainly
recommend it to any Java speakers out there! I hope to come back some
other time :).

So, what's next? Next week I'm speaking at http://mow2012.dk/[Miracle
Open World 2012] in Billund's Legoland park, where I'll be joined by two
other JBoss colleagues,
http://mow2012.dk/speakers/max-rydahl-andersen.aspx[Max Andersen] and
http://mow2012.dk/speakers/thomas-heute.aspx[Thomas Heute]. In this
rather atypical conference, I'll be speaking about
http://mow2012.dk/program/measuring-performance-and-capacity-planning-in-java-based-data-grids.aspx[measuring
performance of in-memory data grids], and about
http://mow2012.dk/program/building-a-transactional,-scaled-application-using-infinispan-and-java-ee.aspx[building
transactional, scalable Infinispan applications]. I was already speaking
at this conference last year, and together with GeeCON, this was one of
my favourite conferences of 2011. Can't wait for next week!

Cheers,
Galder
