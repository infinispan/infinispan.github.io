I won't be able to make it to Devoxx this year, but worry not, the
http://infinispan.blogspot.com/2011/09/javaone-2011-and-devoxx-2011.html[University
talk and hands-on deep-dive on Infinispan] will still go on.  Pete and
Mircea will be joined by
http://community.jboss.org/people/sannegrinovero[Sanne Grinovero] -
maintainer of Infinispan's querying capabilities, Lucene and Hibernate
hacker, and committer on http://ogm.hibernate.org/[Hibernate OGM].  Now
I wish I was attending, as an audience member!  :-)

Enjoy
Manik
