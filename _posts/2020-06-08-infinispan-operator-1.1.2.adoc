== Update Channels and Automatic Upgrades on OpenShift
Starting with this release we are moving channels from a stable/preview structure to a micro-stream structure. This means 
you'll get channels for each major.minor version of Infinispan.

For now version 1.1.x is available on the dev-preview channel but you should switch your Operator subscription to 
the 1.1.x channel before the next release to continue receiving updates.

If you use the Automatic Approval upgrade policy on OpenShift, your cluster is now running Infinispan Operator version 1.1.2 
with the Infinispan 10.1.7.Final server image.
