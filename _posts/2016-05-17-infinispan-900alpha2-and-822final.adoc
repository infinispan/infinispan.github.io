Dear Infinispan users,

we have baked two fresh releases for you today.

First off we have a new micro release of our stable 8.2 branch which
fixes
https://issues.jboss.org/jira/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?projectId=12310799&version=12330034[57
issues]. If you are using any other 8.x release, please upgrade to
8.2.2.Final as this contains a bunch of bugfixes and performance
improvements in all areas.

On top of that we have a brand new Alpha release from our development
branch: 9.0.0.Alpha2 which comes loaded with a few goodies:


* SNI support for HotRod, which paves the way for server multi-tenancy
* JDBC cache stores can use upsert (one of our oldest bugs !!!)
* An httpd-style access log for server
* The new sequential interceptor architecture
* Lucene query caching
* A grand total of 138 issues were resolved
