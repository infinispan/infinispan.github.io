== Infinispan 15 in Devoxx France

This month we participated in one of the biggest developers conference in Europe: Devoxx France in Paris.

Infinispan did not have a specific talk, however it was present indirectly in two talks:

=== Highly available Identity and Access Management with multi-site Keycloak deployments in the cloud

==== Abstract
A single sign on solution for your customers and employees shouldn't be a single-point-of-failure in
your architecture. Keycloak, a popular Open Source Identity and Access Management
solution that provides single sign on, amongst other capabilities, is no exception
to this.
A clustered Keycloak deployment in a single site or datacenter provides sufficient
availability for many. An increasing number of organizations need to utilize multiple
sites for improved resiliency or to meet legal requirements. In 2023, Keycloak
overhauled its multi-site capabilities for public cloud infrastructures, tested them
thoroughly and provided deployment blueprints to the community. They show how to set
up an AWS infrastructure and deploy Keycloak across multiple sites.
This talk presents, from an architects and developer perspective, how we approached
the problem, which architecture we chose, the challenges we faced and which tools
helped us along the way. Expect to dive into concepts like load shedding, cache stampedes, and automated failover. See tools like Gatling, Helm, OpenTelemetry, Kubernetes Operators and AWS infrastructure in action. We will also provide an outlook for the next steps in our journey.
These insights will help you to improve your Keycloak deployments as well as design
and test your own applications so they can withstand high load and site failures.

==== Infinispan
During this presentation, Alexander Schwartz and Ryan Emerson delve into the latest
version of Keycloak and the High Availability architecture that facilitates deploying
two sites with Keycloak.

A key component enabling this architecture is the
Infinispan Server, with its Cross-Site replication capabilities.

This capability is used to provide Active-Passive replication, however the roadmap includes
plans for Active-Active replication in the near future.

=== Hibernate Search 7: New Features and Practical Cases of Java Full-Text and Vector Search

==== Abstract
Hibernate Search 7.0 was released in late 2023, and version 7.1 is already available.
Discover all the new features of this latest version and practical use cases such as
vectorial search (kNN), which enables the implementation of textual, audio, or
image-based machine learning search. This conference will guide you through the
underlying changes, demonstrate concrete use cases, and provide practical tips to make
the most of the latest version of this essential library for data persistence and
full-text search in the Java ecosystem.

==== Infinispan

In the talk, Infinispan was mentioned to highlight that Hibernate Search can function as
a standalone component in a Java Application, independent of Hibernate ORM.
Infinispan utilizes the Hibernate Search library to implement Full-Text search over
cache values. Moreover, since Infinispan 15.0, it can be used as an embedding store to
execute vector search with Langchain and Langchain4j.

=== Les Cast Codeurs Podcast

Mentioning here that Infinispan is indirectly part of Devoxx France and the Les Cast Codeurs podcast too.
(I am, Katia Aresti, part of the Red Coat team and Les Cast Codeurs Podcast with Emmanuel Bernard,
Antonio Goncalves, Guillaume Laforge and Arnaud Heritier).

== What's next

Quarkus and Infinispan integration has undergone significant updates.
Stay tuned for the latest developments by following Quarkus and Infinispan updates.
We'll be participating soon in a Quarkus Insights recording, so keep an eye out for that.

Additionally, this summer, we'll be attending https://rivieradev.fr/[RivieraDev].
Let's connect and catch up over there!
