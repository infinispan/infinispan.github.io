Today, the Quarkus project was released as a public beta.
https://quarkus.io/ For those of you not familiar, Quarkus allows you to
write your enterprise apps as you have done in the past with
Hibernate/JAX-RS, but also to compile these applications to a Graal-VM
native image. Running in a native image allows for the application to be
started up in mere milliseconds, depending upon the app, all while using
much less memory.

The Infinispan team is proud to announce that you can use the HotRod
Java client in Quarkus and supports being compiled to a native image as
well. This can allow you to startup and connect to a remote Infinispan
server faster than ever before.

If you want a quick and simple example of how you can get this working
you can take a look at the quick start which can be found at
https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus-quickstarts/tree/master/infinispan-client.
This example covers configuring the client connection, cache injection
and simple get/put operations as a basis.

The Infinispan Client Quarkus extension in addition to providing an easy
way to create a Graal-VM native image with Infinispan Client also
provides the following features to help the user get stuff done
quicker.

Automatically Inject Important Resources

. RemoteCache (named)
. RemoteCacheManger
. CounterManager

User based ProtoStream Marshalling

Querying (Indexed / Non Indexed)

Continuous Query

Near Cache

Authentication/Authorization

Encryption

Counters


More details for these features as well as how to configure them can be
found at https://quarkus.io/guides/infinispan-client-guide

Please let us know of any questions, concerns or suggestions at the
usual places: https://developer.jboss.org/en/infinispan/content[forum]
or http://infinispan.zulipchat.com/[chat]. We expect to continue
enhancing this extension and would love to have any feedback.
