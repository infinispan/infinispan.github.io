Dear all,

We are proud to announce two releases today:

*Infinispan 8.2.0.Beta1* is the first release in the 8.2 cycle. It
doesn't have big new features, but there are a few significant changes
in addition to the usual
https://issues.jboss.org/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?projectId=12310799&version=12328082[bug
fixes]:

* *SyncConsistentHashFactory* is now the default consistent hash factory
(https://issues.jboss.org/browse/ISPN-4851[ISPN-4851]). This means the
owners of a key are going to be the same in all the caches, as long as
the caches have the same members and the same number of owners.
* We now have a new way for applications to determine the location of
keys: the *KeyPartitioner* interface
(https://issues.jboss.org/browse/ISPN-5465[ISPN-5465]). In spirit it is
very similar to the existing *Grouper* interface, but it is
segment-aware. Note that none of the HotRod clients support
*Keypartitioner* in this release.
* We improved the rolling upgrade performance
(https://issues.jboss.org/browse/ISPN-6046[ISPN-6046]).
* We added a new event logger that records cluster membership, cache
topology, and cache availability changes
(https://issues.jboss.org/browse/ISPN-5816[ISPN-5816]). In the next
release, it will also be accessible through the server's management
console.

*Infinispan 8.1.1.Final* includes a number of
https://issues.jboss.org/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?projectId=12310799&version=12329050[bug
fixes]. All users of 8.1.0.Final are encouraged to upgrade.
