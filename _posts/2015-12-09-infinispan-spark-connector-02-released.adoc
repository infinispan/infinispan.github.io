The connector allows the Infinispan Server to become a data source for
Apache Spark, for both batch jobs and stream processing, including read
and write.

In this release, the highlight is the addition of two new operators to
the RDD that support filtering using native capabilities of Infinispan.
The first one is filterByQuery:



The second operator was introduced to replace the previous configuration

The connector has also been updated to be compatible with Spark 1.5.2
and Infinispan 8.1.0.Final.
