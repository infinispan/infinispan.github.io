Those busy hackers over in the Infinispan dungeon have brewed up a new
release, and it is the first candidate on the road to the final 9.
Infinispan 9.0.0.CR1 (codenamed
"https://www.ruppaner-bodensee.de/die-brauerei/[Ruppaner]") includes a
number of fixes and component upgrades over the last Beta release. You
can read all about these in the
https://issues.jboss.org/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?projectId=12310799&version=12330027[fixed
issues]

Â 

We have also done a lot of work to restructure the
http://infinispan.org/docs/dev/user_guide/user_guide.html[user guide],
http://infinispan.org/docs/dev/upgrading/upgrading.html[upgrade guide]
and http://infinispan.org/docs/dev/server_guide/server_guide.html[server
admin guide] to make it easier to find the answers you need.


So, please head over to the http://infinispan.org/download/[download
page] and try it out. If you have an issue, please report it in our
https://issues.jboss.org/projects/ISPN/summary[bug tracker], ask us on
the https://developer.jboss.org/en/infinispan/content[forum], or join us
for a friendly chat on the #infinispan IRC channel on
http://webchat.freenode.net/[Freenode.]

Prost,

Your friendly Infinispan team
