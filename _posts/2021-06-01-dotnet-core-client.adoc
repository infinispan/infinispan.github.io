Dear Infinispanners,

The Infinispan team would like to share a new project we're working on: https://github.com/infinispan/Infinispan.Hotrod.Core[Infinispan.Hotrod.Core].

Our current .NET client is based on the {cpp} core implementation, which is a solution that has its pros and cons.
It makes it easier to guarantee parity between the {cpp} and C# clients over the time, but has the drawback of tying clients to specific a architecture. 
In turn that complicates portability and distribution, making the release lifecycle for those clients more onerous and sluggish.

The https://github.com/infinispan/Infinispan.Hotrod.Core[Infinispan.Hotrod.Core] is a 100% C# Hot Rod client designed with the aim of being portable across
systems via the .Net Core platform and easier to deploy and consume via the Nuget platform.

If you are involved with the .NET Core ecosystem we hope you will find this project of interest. Entry points for the project are:

* https://github.com/infinispan/Infinispan.Hotrod.Core[Infinispan.Hotrod.Core], current status and news;
* https://github.com/infinispan/Infinispan.Hotrod.Core/tree/main/Infinispan.Hotrod.Core.XUnitTest[XUnit test], this will contain the same testsuite of the
current https://github.com/infinispan/dotnet-client[.NET client] project with the aim of making it easier to compare with the .NET core client as it matures.
* https://github.com/infinispan/Infinispan.Hotrod.Core/tree/main/Infinispan.Hotrod.Application[Sample Application], an example of project which uses the client package.
* https://www.nuget.org/packages/Infinispan.Hotrod.Core/[Nuget] is where the package is published.

Hope this will makes C# developers happy!

Please let us know your thoughts, a good place for them is the https://github.com/infinispan/Infinispan.Hotrod.Core/issues[issues] page.
