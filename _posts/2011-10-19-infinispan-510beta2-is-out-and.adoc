The latest beta of the 5.1 '_Brahma_' series, 5.1.0.BETA2, is out now
and thanks to Dan Berindei, it comes with support for asymmetric
clusters which has been highly demanded.

Before asymmetric clusters were supported, it was required that all
Infinispan caches that client code interacted against were defined and
running in all nodes in the cluster, otherwise, cluster wide messages
for a cache that did not exist in a node would fail. So, imagine this
scenario where #c1# and #c2# are
user defined caches configured with replication:

#Node A [c1]#
#Node B [c1, c2]Â #

Without asymmetric clusters, whenever #c2# cache was
modified in Node B, a replication message would be sent to Node A, but
the replication would fail indicating that c2 was not defined in Node A.
This failure would get propagated back to Node B which would result in
the modification failing. This kind of problems can particularly affect
managed environments such as the JBoss Application Server, because
often, deployments will be made in a subset of the cluster, so it could
well happen that not all nodes have a particular cache started.

So, what Infinispan 5.1.0.BETA2 '_Brahma_' brings is support for this
type of scenarios by maintaining a view correlating nodes and started
caches, hence allowing any node to know which other nodes have a
particular cache started. This means that in the above case, Node B
would not have sent a replication message to Node A because it would
know that #c2# was only started in Node B.

The lack of support for asymmetric clusters is what forced Infinispan
servers to only accept invocations for predefined caches because these
predefined could be started when the servers were started, hence
avoiding the asymmetric cluster problem. Now that asymmetric clusters
are supported, it's likely that this limitation go away, but the
timeline is to be defined yet.

This release also includes a http://goo.gl/s6apG[bunch of other fixes]
and as always, please use the

feedback coming.
