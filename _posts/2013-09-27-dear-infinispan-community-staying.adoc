Dear Infinispan community,



Staying committed to the software development philosophy of "Release
early. Release often. And listen to your customers" we are releasing
Infinispan 6.0.0.Beta2 today. This is mainly a stabilization release
after a flurry of new features released in Beta1. The Beta2 release
contains a few fixes related to hotrod remote clients as well as some
minor fixes in LevelDB cache store.



For a complete list of features and fixes included in this release
please refer to the
