that on the 15th of December, I'll be speaking at the
http://www.alpesjug.fr/[Alpes JUG] in Grenoble about Infinispan. This is
a great opportunity for anyone interested in topics such as data caching
and data grids to come and learn about Infinispan and its ecosystem,
including Hibernate second level cache, Hibernate OGM...etc.

Looking forward to meeting Emannuel and the rest of
the http://www.alpesjug.fr/[Alpes JUG] gang :)

Cheers,
Galder
