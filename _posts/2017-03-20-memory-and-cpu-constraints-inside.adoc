In one of the
http://blog.infinispan.org/2016/07/improved-infinispan-docker-image.html[previous
blog posts] we wrote about different configuration options for our
Docker image. Now we did another step adding auto-configuration steps
for memory and CPU constraints.


== Before we dig in...


Setting memory and CPU constraints to containers is very popular
technique especially for public cloud offerings (such as
https://docs.openshift.org/latest/dev_guide/compute_resources.html[OpenShift]).
Behind the scenes everything works based on adding
https://docs.docker.com/engine/admin/resource_constraints/[additional
Docker settings] to the containers. There are two very popular
switches: _--memory_ (which is responsible for setting the amount of
available memory) and _--cpu-quota_ (which throttles CPU usage).

Now here comes the best part... JDK has no idea about those settings! We
will probably need to wait until
http://hg.openjdk.java.net/jdk9/jdk9/hotspot/rev/5f1d1df0ea49[JDK9] for
getting full CGroups support.


== What can we do about it?


The answer is very simple, we need to tell JDK what is the available
memory (at least by setting _Xmx_) and available number of CPUs (by
setting http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/articles/java/g1gc-1984535.html[_XX:ParallelGCThreads_, _XX:ConcGCThreads_]
and _https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/ForkJoinPool.html[Djava.util.concurrent.ForkJoinPool.common.parallelism]_).

And we have some very good news! We already did it for you!


== Let's test it out!


At first you need to pull our latest Docker image:


Then run it with CPU and memory limits using the following command:


Note that JAVA_OPTS variable was overridden. Let's have a look what had
happened:

* -Xms64m -Xmx350m - it is always a good idea to
https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2014/07/15/dude-wheres-my-paas-memory-tuning-javas-footprint-in-openshift-part-1/[set
_Xmn_] inside a Docker container. Next we set _Xmx_ to 70% of available
memory. 
* -XX:ParallelGCThreads=6 -XX:ConcGCThreads=6
-Djava.util.concurrent.ForkJoinPool.common.parallelism=6 - The next
thing is setting CPU throttling as I explained above.

There might be some cases where you wouldn't like to set those
properties automatically. In that case, just pass _-n_ switch to the
starter script:
