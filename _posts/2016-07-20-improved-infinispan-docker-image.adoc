The https://hub.docker.com/r/jboss/infinispan-server/[Infinispan Docker
image] has been improved, making it easier to run Infinispan Servers in
clustered, domain and standalone modes, with different protocol
stacks.

In this blog post we'll show a few usage scenarios and how to combine it
with the https://hub.docker.com/r/jboss/jgroups-gossip/[jgroups-gossip]
image to create Infinispan Server clusters in docker based
environments.

==== 

===== 

==== Getting started

===== 

By default the container runs in clustered mode, and to start a node
simply execute:



Bringing a second container will cause it to form a cluster.The
membership can be verified by running a command directly in the newly
launched container:




Example output:




===== 

==== Using a different JGroups stack

===== 

The command above creates a cluster with the default JGroups stack
(UDP), but it's possible to pick another one provided it's supported by
the server. For example, to use TCP:




==== Running on cloud environments


We recently dockerized the JGroups Gossip Router to be used as an
alternative discovery mechanism in environments where multicast is not
enabled, such as cloud environments.

Employing  a gossip router will enable discovery via TCP, where the
router acts as a registry: each member will register itself in this
registry upon start and also discover other members.

The gossip router container can be launched by: 
   


Take note of the address where the router will bind to, it's needed by
the Infinispan nodes. The address can be easily obtained by:
   


Finally we can now launch our cluster specifying the tcp-gossip stack
with the location of the gossip router:




==== Launching Standalone mode


Passing an extra parameter allows to run a server in standalone
(non-clustered) mode:




===== 

==== Server Management Console in Domain mode

===== 

Domain mode is a special case of clustered mode (and currently a
requirement to use the Server Management Console), that involves
launching a domain controller process plus one or more host controller
processes. The domain controller does not hold data, it is used as a
centralized management process that can replicate configuration and
provision servers on the host controllers.

Running a domain controller is easily achievable with a parameter:


Once the domain controller is running, it's possible to start one or
more host controllers. In the default configuration, each host
controller has two Infinispan server instances:



The command line interface can be used to verify the hosts managed in
the domain:


It should output all the host names that are part of the domain,
including the master (domain controller):



To get access to the Management console, use credentials admin/admin and
go to port 9990 of the domain controller, for example:
http://172.17.0.2:9990/[http://172.17.0.2:9990/]



==== Versions


The image is built on
https://hub.docker.com/r/jboss/infinispan-server/[Dockerhub] shortly
after each Infinispan release (stable and unstable), and the
improvements presented in this post are available for Infinispan
9.0.0.Alpha3 and Infinispan 8.2.3.Final. As a reminder, make sure to
pick the right version when launching containers:




Getting involved


The image was created to be flexible and easy to use, but if something
is not working for you or if you have any suggestions to improve it,
please report it at

Enjoy!
