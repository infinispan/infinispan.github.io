In the
http://blog.infinispan.org/2016/08/running-infinispan-cluster-on-openshift.html[previous
post] we looked how to run Infinispan on OpenShift. Today, our goal is
exactly the same, but we'll focus on Kubernetes.

Running Infinispan on Kubernetes requires using proper discovery
protocol. This blog post uses
https://github.com/jgroups-extras/jgroups-kubernetes[Kubernetes Ping]
but it's also possible to use
http://blog.infinispan.org/2016/07/improved-infinispan-docker-image.html[Gossip
Router].

===== Our goal

We'd like to build Infinispan cluster based on Kubernetes hosted locally
(using https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube[Minikube]). We will expose
a service and route it to our local machine. Finally, we will use it to
put data into the grid.

===== Spinning local Kubernetes cluster

There are many ways to spin up a local Kubernetes cluster. One of my
favorites is https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube[Minikube]. At first
you will need the 'minikube' binary, which can be downloaded from
https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube/releases[Github releases page]. I
usually copy it into '/usr/bin' which makes it very convenient to use.
The next step is to download 'kubectl' binary. I usually use Kubernetes
https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/releases[Github releases page]
for this. The 'kubectl' binary is stored inside the release archive
under
'kubernetes/platforms/<your_platform>/<your_architecture>/kubectl'. I'm
using linux/amd64 since I'm running Fedora F23. I also copy the binary
to '/usr/bin'.



We are ready to spin up Kubernetes:





===== Deploying Infinispan cluster

This time we'll focus on automation, so there will be no 'kubectl edit'
commands. Below is the yaml file for creating all necessary components
in Kubernetes cluster:



* (lines 23 - 24) - We added additional arguments to the bootstrap scipt
* (lines 26 - 30) - We used Downward API for pass the current namespace
to the Infinispan
* (lines 34 - 45) - We defined all ports used by the Pod
* (lines 49 - 66) - We created a service for port 8080 (the REST
interface)
* (line 64) - We used
http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/services/#type-nodeport[NodePort
service type] which we will expose via Minikube in the next paragraph



Save it somewhere on the disk and execute 'kubectl create' command:





===== Exposing the service port

One of the
https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube#known-issues[Minikube's
limitations] is that it can't use
http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/ingress/[Ingress API] and expose
services to the outside world. Thankfully there's other way - use Node
Port service type. With this simple trick we will be able to access the
service using '<minikube_ip>:<node_port_number>'. The port number was
specified in the yaml file (we could leave it blank and let Kubernetes
assign random one). The node port can easily be checked using the
following command:




In order to obtain the Kubernetes node IP, use the following command:





===== Testing the setup

Testing is quite simple and the only thing to remember is to use the
proper address - <minikube_ip>:<node_port>:





===== Clean up

Minikube has all-in-one command to do the clean up:





===== Conclusion

Kubernetes setup is almost identical to the OpenShift one but there are
a couple of differences to keep in mind:

* OpenShift's DeploymentConfiguration is similar Kubernetes Deployment
with ReplicaSets
* OpenShift's Services work the same way as in Kubernetes
* OpenShift's Routes are similar to Kubernetes' Ingresses

Happy scaling and don't forget to check if Infinispan formed a cluster
(hint - look into the
http://blog.infinispan.org/2016/08/running-infinispan-cluster-on-openshift.html[previous
post]).
