A couple weeks ago saw the final release of JBoss AS 7.0. Like AS6
before it, AS7 uses Infinispan as the distributed caching solution
behind its clustering functionality. So what do you need to know about
using Infinispan in AS7?


== Configuration


Unlike previous releases of JBoss AS, AS7 centralizes all server
configuration into one location. This include Infinispan cache
configurations, which are defined by the Infinispan subsystem, within
domain.xml or standalone.xml:

https://raw.github.com/jbossas/jboss-as/7.0.0.Final/build/src/main/resources/domain/configuration/domain.xml[$JBOSS_HOME/domain/configuration/domain.xml]

https://raw.github.com/jbossas/jboss-as/7.0.0.Final/build/src/main/resources/standalone/configuration/standalone-ha.xml[$JBOSS_HOME/standalone/configuration/standalone-ha.xml]


The complete schema for the Infinispan subsystem is included in the AS7
binary distribution:

https://raw.github.com/jbossas/jboss-as/7.0.0.Final/build/src/main/resources/docs/schema/jboss-infinispan.xsd[$JBOSS_HOME/docs/schema/jboss-infinispan.xsd]


If you are familiar with Infinispan's native configuration file format
or the corresponding configuration file from AS6, you'll notice some
obvious similarities, but some noteworthy differences.

While a native Infinispan configuration file contains cache
configurations for a single cache container, like AS6, the Infinispan
subsystem configuration defines multiple cache containers, each
identified by a name. As with AS6, cache containers can have 1 or more
aliases.


=== Being concise


The Infinispan subsystem's configuration schema attempts to be more
concise than the equivalent configuration in AS6. This is a direct
result of the following changes:

==== Where is <global/>?

Much of the global configuration contains references to other AS
services. In AS7, these services are auto-injected behind the scenes.
This includes things like thread pools (described below), the JGroups
transport (also described below), and the mbean server.

==== Configuration default values

AS7 supplies a set of custom default values for various configuration
properties. These defaults differ depending on the cache mode. The
complete set of default values can be found here:

https://github.com/jbossas/jboss-as/blob/master/clustering/infinispan/src/main/resources/infinispan-defaults.xml

==== File-based cache store

Because clustering services use the file-based cache store frequently,
we've simplified its definition. First, by using a distinctive element,
you no longer need to specify the class name. The location of the store
is defined by 2 attributes:

_______________________________________________________________
#<file-store relative-to="..." path="..."/>#
_______________________________________________________________

The _relative-to_ attribute defines a named path, and defaults to the
server's data directory; whereas the _path_ attribute specifies the
directory within _relative-to_, and defaults to the cache container
name.

==== Specifying cache mode

Instead of defining the cache mode via a separate <clustering
mode="..."/> attribute, each cache mode uses it's own element, the child
elements of which are specific to that cache mode. For example,
rehashing properties are only available within the <distributed-cache/>
element.

==== Where is <default/>?

The semantics of the default cache of a cache container are different in
AS7 than in native Infinispan. In native Infinispan, the configuration
within <default/> defines the cache returned by calls to
_CacheContainer.getCache()_, while <namedCache/> entries inherit the
configuration from the default cache.
In AS7, all caches defined in the Infinispan subsystem are named caches.
The _default-cache_ attribute identifies which named cache should be
returned by calls to _CacheContainer.getCache()_. This lets you easily
modify the default cache of a cache container, without having to worry
about rearranging configuration property inheritance.


=== Specifying a transport


The Infinispan subsystem uses with the JGroups subsystem to provide it's
JGroups channel. By default, cache containers use the _default-stack_ as
defined by the JGroups subsystem.

_________________________________________________________________________________________
#<subsystem xmlns="urn:jboss:domain:jgroups:1.0"
default-stack="udp">#

#  <stack name="udp">#

#    <!-- ... -->#

#  </stack>#

#  <stack name="tcp">#

#    <!-- ... -->#

#  </stack>#

#</subsystem>#
_________________________________________________________________________________________

Changing the default stack for all clustering services is a simple as
changing the _default-stack_ attribute defined in the JGroups subsystem.
An individual cache-container can opt to use a particular stack by
specifying a _stack_ attribute within its _transport_ element.

#e.g.#

__________________________________________________________________________________
#<cache-container name="web" default-cache="repl">#

#  <transport stack="tcp"/>#

#  <replicated-cache name="repl" mode="ASYNC"
batching="true">#

#    <locking isolation="REPEATABLE_READ"/>#

#    <file-store/>#

#  </replicated-cache>#

#</cache-container>#
__________________________________________________________________________________

JGroups channels are named using the cache container name.


=== Defining thread pools


Cache containers defined by the Infinispan subsystem can reference
thread pools defined by the threading subsystem. Externalizing thread
pool in this way has the additional advantage of being able to manage
the thread pools via native JBoss AS management mechanisms, and allows
you to share thread pools across cache containers.

e.g.

_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
#<cache-container name="web" default-cache="repl"
listener-executor="infinispan-listener"
eviction-executor="infinispan-eviction"
replication-queue-executor="infinispan-repl-queue">#

#  <transport executor="infinispan-transport"/>#

# <replicated-cache name="repl" mode="ASYNC"
batching="true">#

#    <locking isolation="REPEATABLE_READ"/>#

# <file-store/>#

#  </replicated-cache>#

#</cache-container>#

#
#

#<subsystem xmlns="urn:jboss:domain:threads:1.0">#

#  <thread-factory name="infinispan-factory"
priority="1"/>#

#  <bounded-queue-thread-pool
name="infinispan-transport"/>#

#     <core-threads count="1"/>#

#    <queue-length count="100000"/>#

#    <max-threads count="25"/>#

#    <thread-factory name="infinispan-factory"/>#

#  </bounded-queue-thread-pool>#

#  <bounded-queue-thread-pool
name="infinispan-listener"/>#

#    <core-threads count="1"/>#

#    <queue-length count="100000"/>#

#    <max-threads count="1"/>#

#    <thread-factory name="infinispan-factory"/>#

#  </bounded-queue-thread-pool>#

#  <scheduled-thread-pool
name="infinispan-eviction"/>#

#    <max-threads count="1"/>#

#    <thread-factory name="infinispan-factory"/>#

#  </scheduled-thread-pool>#

#  <scheduled-thread-pool
name="infinispan-repl-queue"/>#

#    <max-threads count="1"/>#

#    <thread-factory name="infinispan-factory"/>#

#  </scheduled-thread-pool>#

#</subsystem>
#
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________



== Cache container lifecycle


During AS6 server startup, the _CacheContainerRegistry_ service would
create and start all cache containers defined within its
_infinispan-configs.xml_ file. Individual caches were started and
stopped as needed. Lifecycle control of a cache was the complete
responsibility of the application or service that used it.
Instead of a separate _CacheContainerRegistry_, AS7 uses the generic
_ServiceRegistry_ from the jboss-msc project (i.e. JBoss Modular Service
Container). When AS7 starts, it creates on-demand services for each
cache and cache container defined in the Infinispan subsystem. A service
or deployment that needs to use a given cache or cache container simply
adds a dependency on the relevant service name. When the service or
deployment stops, dependent services are stopped as well, provided they
are not still demanded by some other service or deployment. In this way,
AS7 handles cache and cache container lifecycle for you.

There may be an occasion where you'd like a cache to start eagerly when
the server starts, without requiring a dependency from some service or
deployment. This can be achieve by using the start attribute of a
cache.

e.g.

__________________________________________________________________________________________________
#<cache-container name="cluster"
default-cache="default">#

#  <alias>ha-partition</alias>#

#  <replicated-cache name="default" mode="SYNC"
batching="true" start="EAGER">#

#    <locking isolation="REPEATABLE_READ"/>#

#  </replicated-cache>#

#</cache-container>#
__________________________________________________________________________________________________



== Using an Infinispan cache directly


AS7 adds the ability to inject an Infinispan cache into your application
using standard JEE mechanisms. This is perhaps best explained by an
example:

_____________________________________________________________________________________
#@ManagedBean#

#public class MyBean<K, V> \{#

#  @Resource(lookup="java:jboss/infinispan/_my-container-name_")
#

#  private org.infinispan.manager.CacheContainer
container;#

#  private org.infinispan.Cache<K, V> cache;

#

#  @PostConstruct#

#  public void start() \{#

#    this.cache = this.container.getCache();#

#  }#

#}#
_____________________________________________________________________________________

That's it! No JBoss specific classes required - only standard JEE
annotations. Pretty neat, no?

##


There's only one catch - due to the AS's use of modular classloading,
Infinispan classes are not available to deployments by default. You need
to explicitly tell the AS to import the Infinispan API into your
application. This is most easily done by adding the following line to
your application's _META-INF/MANIFEST.MF_:

##

___________________________________
Dependencies: org.infinispan export
___________________________________

So, how does it all work? If you recall, during server startup, the AS
creates and registers an on-demand service for every Infinispan cache
container defined in the Infinispan subsystem. For every cache
container, the Infinispan subsystem also creates and registers a JNDI
binding service that depends on the associated cache container service.
When the AS deployer encounters the _@Resource(lookup)_ annotation, it
automatically adds a dependency to the application on the JNDI binding
service associated with the specified JNDI name. In the case of the
Infinispan JNDI binding, the binding itself already depends on the
relevant Infinispan cache container service. The net effect is, your
application will include a dependency on the requested cache container.
Consequently, the cache container will automatically start on deploy,
and stop (including all caches) on undeploy.
