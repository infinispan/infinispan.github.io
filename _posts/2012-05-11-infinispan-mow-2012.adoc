A couple of weeks back I was speaking about Infinispan and Radargun at
http://mow2012.dk/[MOW 2012]. Although this conference was originally
focused on Oracle products, for a over a year now, Miracle have been
expanding into other territories, such as Microsoft and Java middleware.
However, there's still some work to be done in this area in order to
make this a must-go conference for Java developers. Max Andersen and
Thomas Heute were presenting as well on topics such as: Ceylon, JBoss
AS7 and OpenShift.

If you want to find out more about Infinispan, don't miss
