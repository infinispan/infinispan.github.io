Yes, yet another alpha for Infinispan 4.2.0 codenamed _Ursus_.  What's
new in this alpha?  A lot of bug fixes, reported by you the community,
on earlier alphas as well as on 4.1.0 _Radegast_.  For a full list of
what's changed, please consult

Please do give this release a spin and provide as much feedback as you
can.  A feature-complete beta is imminent and we expect it to be very
stable - as far as betas go - and all thanks to your feedback.
