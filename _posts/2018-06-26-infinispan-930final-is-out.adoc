We're delighted to announce the release of Infinispan 9.3.0.Final, which
is a culmination of several months of hard work by the entire Infinispan
community. Here's a summary of what you can find within it:


First final release to work with both Java 8 and Java 10. Note that
Infinispan only works in classpath mode.

Transaction support Hot Rod.Â The java Hot Rod client can participate in
Java transactions via Synchronization or XA enlistment. Note that
recovery isn't supported yet.

Caches can now configure the maximum number of attempts to start a
CacheWriter/CacheLoader on startup before cache creation fails.

Write-behind stores are now fault-tolerant by default.

Segmented On Heap Data Container. It improves performance of stream
operations.

Server upgraded to Wildfly 13.

We have introduced several WildFly feature packs to make it easier for
Infinispan to be utilised on WildFly instances via the Server
Provisioning Plugin. The following feature packs have been created, most
notably:

infinispan-feature-pack-client

* All of the modules required to connect to a hotrod server via the
client

infinispan-feature-pack-embedded

* The modules required for embedded instances of Infinispan

infinispan-feature-pack-embedded-query

* The same as above but with query capabilities

infinispan-feature-pack-wf-modules

* This is equivalent to the Wildfly-modules.zip

Hibernate second-level cache provider works with Hibernate ORM 5.3.

The Hot Rod Server allows now to use multiple protocols with a Single
Port. The initial version supports HTTP/1.1, HTTP/2 and Hot Rod.
Switching protocols can be done using TLS/ALPN and HTTP/1.1 Upgrade
header.

Admin console - improved all editors (schema, scripts, JSON data) to
include syntax highlighting.

Several enhancements in the Java Hot Rod client allowing to read and
write data in different formats such as JSON, for cache operations and
deployed filters/converters.

Cluster wide max idle expiration.

Component Upgrades

* Hibernate Search 5.10
* Hibernate ORM 5.3

Numerous bug fixes which improve stability

Cheers,
