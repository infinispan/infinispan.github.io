To help you jump-start a new project using Infinispan, we now have Maven
Archetypes you can use.  If you don't know what a Maven Archetype is,
you should read
http://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-archetypes.html[this
article] which explains archetypes in more detail.  Of course, this
assumes that you are using http://maven.apache.org/[Maven] as a build
tool.



We've created two separate archetypes for Infinispan.  The first sets
you up with a clean, new directory structure and sample code for a new
Infinispan project, including sample configuration files and skeleton
code, as well as a Maven pom.xml descriptor containing all necessary
dependencies.



The second archetype is targeted towards people using Infinispan and
want to report bugs and contribute tests to the project.  It sets up a
new project with a skeleton functional test, including all of
Infinispan's test helper utilities to simulate network setup and failure
from within a test.  More important, the generated skeleton test is
structured such that it can easily be assimilated into Infinispan's core
test suite if necessary.



For more information on these archetypes, including a simple
step-by-step guide,
