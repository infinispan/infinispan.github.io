Infinispan users worried about memory consumption should upgrade to
http://infinispan.blogspot.cz/2013/06/infinispan-530final-is-out.html[Infinispan
5.3.0.Final] as soon as possible, because as part of the work we've done
to https://docs.jboss.org/author/x/2oD2Aw[support storing byte arrays
without wrappers], and the development of the
http://infinispan.blogspot.co.uk/2013/05/interoperability-between-embedded-and.html[interoperability
mode], we've been working to reduce Infinispan's memory overhead.

To measure overhead, we've
used http://infinispan.blogspot.cz/2013/01/infinispan-memory-overhead.html[Martin
Gencur's excellent memory consumption tests]. The results for entries
with 512 bytes are:

Infinispan memory overhead, used in library mode:
Infinispan 5.2.0.Final: ~151 bytes
Infinispan 5.3.0.Final: ~135 bytes
Memory consumption reduction: ~12%

Infinispan memory overhead, for the Hot Rod server:
Infinispan 5.2.0.Final: ~174 bytes
Infinispan 5.3.0.Final: ~151 bytes
Memory consumption reduction: ~15%



Infinispan memory overhead, for the REST server:
Infinispan 5.2.0.Final: ~208 bytes
Infinispan 5.3.0.Final: ~172 bytes
Memory consumption reduction: ~21%



Infinispan memory overhead, for the Memcached server:

Infinispan 5.2.0.Final: ~184 bytes

Infinispan 5.3.0.Final: ~180 bytes
Memory consumption reduction: ~2%



This is great news for the Infinispan community but our effort doesn't
end here. We'll be working on further improvements in next releases to
bring down cost even further.


Cheers,
