Infinispan users worried about memory consumption should upgrade to
http://infinispan.blogspot.cz/2013/06/infinispan-530final-is-out.html[Infinispan
5.3.0.Final] as soon as possible, because as part of the work we've done
to https://docs.jboss.org/author/x/2oD2Aw[support storing byte arrays
without wrappers], and the development of the
http://infinispan.blogspot.co.uk/2013/05/interoperability-between-embedded-and.html[interoperability
mode], we've been working to reduce Infinispan's memory overhead.

To measure overhead, we've
used http://infinispan.blogspot.cz/2013/01/infinispan-memory-overhead.html[Martin
Gencur's excellent memory consumption tests]. The results for entries
with 512 bytes are:

Infinispan memory overhead, used in library mode:
Infinispan 5.2.0.Final: ~151 bytes
Infinispan 5.3.0.Final: ~135 bytes
Memory consumption reduction: ~12%

Infinispan memory overhead, for the Hot Rod server:
Infinispan 5.2.0.Final: ~174 bytes
Infinispan 5.3.0.Final: ~151 bytes
Memory consumption reduction: ~15%



Infinispan memory overhead, for the REST server:
Infinispan 5.2.0.Final: ~208 bytes
Infinispan 5.3.0.Final: ~172 bytes
Memory consumption reduction: ~21%



Infinispan memory overhead, for the Memcached server:

Infinispan 5.2.0.Final: ~184 bytes

Infinispan 5.3.0.Final: ~180 bytes
Memory consumption reduction: ~2%



This is great news for the Infinispan community but our effort doesn't
end here. We'll be working on further improvements in next releases to
bring down cost even further.


Cheers,

Galder
