As we head towards the latter part of Infinispan 5.3 series, we're doing
a series of blog posts where we provide more detailed information of
some of the key features in this release.

As part of Infinispan 5.3.0.Beta1, we added the ability to store data
directly in Infinispan which previously would have required using a
custom wrapper object, e.g. arrays. The way Infinispan supports storing
these type of objects is by allowing a custom
https://github.com/infinispan/infinispan/blob/master/core/src/main/java/org/infinispan/util/Equivalence.java[Equivalence]
function to be configured for keys and/or values.

This is a less cumbersome method that enables object requiring custom
equals/hashCode implementations to be stored without incurring on a
extra cost per cache entry. We've already been using this internally to
store Hot Rod, REST and Memcached data where keys and/or values can be
byte arrays, and we've seen some nice improvements in terms of memory
consumption.

A nice side effect of being able to store byte arrays natively is that
it makes sharing data between multiple endpoints less cumbersome since
you're now dealing with byte arrays directly instead of having to
wrap/unwrap the byte arrays. More on this topic very shortly.

Full details on how to implement and configure these
new https://github.com/infinispan/infinispan/blob/master/core/src/main/java/org/infinispan/util/Equivalence.java[Equivalence] functions
can be found in the https://docs.jboss.org/author/x/2oD2Aw[Infinispan
community documentation]. To give this a go, make sure you
