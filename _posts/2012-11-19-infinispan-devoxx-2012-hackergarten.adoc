Just came back from http://www.devoxx.com/display/DV12/Home[Devoxx], and
once again it didn't let me down! Great conference, with awesome talks,
and fantastic networking opportunities (hackergarten, party...etc). As
far as Infinispan is concerned, I joined the
http://www.jroller.com/aalmiray/entry/hackergarten_devoxx_2012[Hackergarten]
on Tuesday morning to try lure some contributors into our project :).

One of the most promising opportunities came from
https://github.com/lordofthejars[Alex Soto], who's founder and lead of
https://github.com/lordofthejars/nosql-unit[NoSQLUnit], which is a JUnit
extension that helps you write NoSQL unit tests. He already has support
for a number of NoSQL engines and he was explaining me the challenges of
supporting multiple engines. We also discussed the possibility of
supporting Infinispan as well :D.

During the Hackergarten I also met
http://www.jroller.com/aalmiray/[Andrés Almiray], which is the
http://griffon.codehaus.org/[Griffon] founder, and we briefly discussed
the possibility of adding integrating
https://docs.jboss.org/author/x/NgY5[Infinispan's Hot Rod client] with
Griffon clients. Unfortunately we didn't have time to get into some
coding, but since he lives close-by and he organises Hackergartens in
Basel, I might pop in next time around and sit down with him to work on
this integration :).

Can't wait for next Devoxx!!

Cheers,
Galder
