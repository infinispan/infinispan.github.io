So today I've finally cut the much-awaited Infinispan 4.0.0.BETA1.
Codenamed Starobrno - after the
http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2156/2407448703_b6be704417.jpg?v=1208022238[Czech
beer] that was omnipresent during early planning sessions of Infinispan
- Beta1 is finally feature-complete. This is also the first release
where
http://infinispan.blogspot.com/2009/08/distribution-instead-of-buddy.html[distribution]
is complete, with rehashing on joins and leaves implemented as well. In
addition, a number of bugs reported on previous alpha releases have been
tended to.

This is a hugely important release for Infinispan. No more features will
be added to 4.0.0, and all efforts will now focus on stability,
performance and squashing bugs. And for this we need your help!
Download, try out, feedback. And you will be rewarded with a rock-solid,
lightning-fast final release that you can depend on.

Some things that have changed since the alphas include a better
mechanism of

caches and overriding configurations], and a new

XML reference guide]. Don't forget the

There are a lot of folk to thank - way too many to list here, but you
all know who you are. For a full set of release notes, visit
