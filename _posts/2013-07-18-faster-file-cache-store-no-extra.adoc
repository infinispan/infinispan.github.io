As
http://infinispan.blogspot.ch/2013/07/infinispan-600alpha1-is-out.html[announced
yesterday by Adrian], the brand new Infinispan 6.0.0.Alpha1 release
contains a new file-based cache store which needs no extra dependencies.
This is essentially a replacement of the existing FileCacheStore which
didn't perform as expected, and caused major issues due to the number of
files it created.

The new cache store, contributed by a https://github.com/kblees[Karsten
Blees] (who also contributed an improved asynchronous cache store), is
called
https://github.com/infinispan/infinispan/blob/master/core/src/main/java/org/infinispan/loaders/file/SingleFileCacheStore.java[SingleFileCacheStore]
and it keeps all data in a single file. The way it looks up data is by
keeping an in-memory index of keys and the positions of their values in
this file. This design outperforms the existing FileCacheStore and even
LevelDB based JNI cache store.

The classic case for a file based cache store is when you want to have a
cache with a cache store available locally which stores data that has
overflowed from memory, having exceeded size and/or time restrictions.
We ran some performance tests to verify how fast different cache store
implementations could deal with reading and writing overflowed data, and
these are the results we got (in Ks):


* FileCacheStore: 0.75k reads/s, 0.285k writes/s
* LevelDB-JNI impl: 46k reads/s, 15.2k writes/s
* SingleFileCacheStore: 458k reads/s, 137k writes/s

The difference is quite astonishing but as already hinted, this
performance increase comes at a cost. Having to maintain an index of
keys and positions in the file in memory has a cost in terms of extra
memory required, and potential impact on GC. That's why the
SingleFileCacheStore is not recommended for use cases where the keys are
too big.



In order to help tame this memory consumption issues, the
http://docs.jboss.org/infinispan/6.0/apidocs/org/infinispan/configuration/cache/SingleFileCacheStoreConfigurationBuilder.html#maxEntries(int)[size
of the cache store can be optionally limited, providing a maximum number
of entries to store in it]. However, setting this parameter will only
work in use cases where Infinispan is used as a cache. When used as a
cache, data not present in Infinispan can be recomputed or re-retrieved
from the authoritative data store and stored in Infinispan cache. The
reason for this limitation is because once the maximum number of entries
is reached, older data in the cache store is removed, so if Infinispan
was used as an authoritative data store, it would lead to data loss
which is not good.



Existing FileCacheStore users might wonder: what is it gonna happen to
the existing FileCacheStore? We're not 100% sure yet what we're going to
do with it, but we're looking into some ways to migrate data from the
FileCacheStore to the SingleFileCacheStore.
https://issues.jboss.org/browse/ISPN-3318[Some interesting ideas] have
already been submitted which we'll investigate in next Infinispan 6.0
pre-releases.



So, if you're a FileCacheStore user, give the new SingleFileCacheStore a
go and let us know how it goes! Switching from one to the other is
https://github.com/infinispan/infinispan/blob/master/core/src/test/java/org/infinispan/loaders/file/SingleFileCacheStoreFunctionalTest.java#L58[easy]
