As you're probably well aware, the Infinispan team is delivering talks
all around the world. If you're in the US and you want to find out more
Infinispan/EDG,
http://infinispan.blogspot.com/2011/09/javaone-2011-and-devoxx-2011.html[Manik
will be speaking at JavaOne], but if like me you're staying out in
Europe, why not come to http://soft-shake.ch/en/[Soft Shake] in
Geneva?

http://soft-shake.ch/en/[Soft Shake] is an IT conference being held in
Geneva on October 3rd and 4th and http://soft-shake.ch/en/schedule/[I'll
be speaking] about data grids and data caching with Infinispan on the
3rd. In fact, I'll be speaking twice! At 1pm you'll see me doing an
introduction to data grids and data caching, and at 5pm I'll be delving
into the data grid vs database debate.

So, if any of this topics interest you, come and join us at Soft Shake!
It's gonna be fun :)

And that is not all! I'll be one of the Infinispan team members speaking
in JUDCon London at the end of October. The
http://www.jboss.org/events/JUDCon/2011/london/agenda.html[agenda] is
now live and you'll see me talking about near caching on the 31st of
October. Don't miss it!

Cheers,
Galder
