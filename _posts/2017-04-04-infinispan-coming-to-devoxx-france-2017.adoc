Infinispan will be present in Devoxx France from 5th to 7th April 2017.
Emmanuel Bernard and myself will be speaking about
http://cfp.devoxx.fr/2017/talk/UKK-0693/Architecture_par_la_pratique:_patterns_d%E2%80%99utilisation_de_systemes_in-memory_-_WD-40_entre_vos_donnees_et_vos_applis[in-memory
data grid use cases] with some cool demos around rail train transport
(who doesn't love trains?).

So, if you're at Devoxx France, or considering going there, and want to
find out more about in-memory data grids and Infinispan, make sure you
come to our talk!!

Cheers,
Galder
