The trip started in Coimbra where Sanne Grinovero and I
http://infinispan.blogspot.com/2012/04/infinispan-and-ogm-at-ptjug.html[discussed
about Infinispan and OGM] at the Portugal JUG. The interest was obvious
from the amount of questions and the discussions that followed and ended
up late in the night. A big thanks to http://www.samaxes.com/[Samuel
Santos] for organising this!

The trip then continued in Lisbon where we meet the
http://www.cloudtm.eu/[CloudTM] team for two good days of hacking
and brainstorming.  The results are a set of awesome features
the http://www.cloudtm.eu/[CloudTM] is about to contribute to
Infinispan, especially around transactions:

* Total Order Broadcast (TOB) - is a transaction protocol for replicated
caches built on http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_broadcast[atomic
broadcast]. It relies on http://www.jgroups.org/[JGroups'] 
http://www.jgroups.org/javadoc-3.x/org/jgroups/protocols/SEQUENCER.html[SEQUENCER] protocol
for achieving total order. The benchmarks ran comparing it with the
current 2PC based transaction protocol are rather promising and we hope
to integrated it in our 5.2 release
* Total Order Multicast (TOM) - is simplistically put TOB for
distributed caches. This is the next in pipe after TOB to be integrated.
Again, preliminary performance comparisons look rather promising
* The  http://www.cloudtm.eu/[CloudTM] also extended Infinispan's
transactions to support one-copy serializability (that's a fancy name
for SERIALIZABLE  transactions in replicated systems). The
implementation is based on keeping multiple data version of data for
each entry together with some housekeeping code. More on this to come!

Big thanks to http://www.cloudtm.eu/[CloudTM] team for their effort and
all the great ideas (and patches!!) they submitted to Infinispan! It was
a great meeting with very good results and burning whiteboards (see
below)!
