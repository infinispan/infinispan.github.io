The feedback keeps coming, particularly from AS7 users, so we've decided
to do another point release in the 5.1 'Brahma' series. Apart from
fixing several issues, including
https://issues.jboss.org/browse/ISPN-1915[a critical L1 cache memory
leak in active/passive set ups], this version
https://issues.jboss.org/browse/ISPN-1367[enables the JBoss Marshaller
class resolver to be configured] via both the old and new programmatic
configuration API. This enables Infinispan to provide a better solution
for https://community.jboss.org/docs/DOC-17244[marshalling/unmarshalling
classes in modular environments].

Full details of what has been fixed can be found
https://issues.jboss.org/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?projectId=12310799&version=12319263[here],
and if you have feedback, please visit
http://community.jboss.org/en/infinispan?view=discussions[our forums].
Finally, as always, you can download the release from
http://www.jboss.org/infinispan/downloads[here].

Cheers,
Galder
