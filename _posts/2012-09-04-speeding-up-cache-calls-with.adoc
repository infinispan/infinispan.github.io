Starting with
http://infinispan.blogspot.cz/2012/09/infinispan-520alpha3-is-out.html[Infinispan
5.2.0.Alpha3], a new Infinispan invocation flag has been added called
http://docs.jboss.org/infinispan/5.2/apidocs/org/infinispan/context/Flag.html#IGNORE_RETURN_VALUES[IGNORE_RETURN_VALUES].

This flag signals that the client that calls an Infinispan Cache
operation () which has some kind of return, i.e.
http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/Map.html#put(K,%20V)[java.util.Map#put(Object,
Object)] (remember that Infinispan's Cache interface extends
java.util.Map), the return value (which in the case of
http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/Map.html#put(K,%20V)[java.util.Map#put(Object,
Object)] represents the previous value) will be ignored by the client
application. A typical client application that ignores the return value
would use code like this:

In this example, both cache put call are ignoring the return of the put
call, which returns the previous value. In other words, when we cache
the last login date, we don't care what the previous value was, so this
is a great opportunity for the client code to be re-written in this way:

Or even better:

Thanks to such hints, *Infinispan caches can behave in a more efficient
way and can potentially do operations faster*, because work associated
with the production of the return value will be skipped. Such work can
on occasions involve network calls, or access to persistent cache
stores, so by avoiding this work, the cache calls are effectively
faster.

In previous Infinispan versions, a similar effect could be achieved with
flags with a narrower target and which are considered too brittle for
end user consumption such as
http://docs.jboss.org/infinispan/5.2/apidocs/org/infinispan/context/Flag.html#SKIP_REMOTE_LOOKUP[SKIP_REMOTE_LOOKUP]
or
http://docs.jboss.org/infinispan/5.2/apidocs/org/infinispan/context/Flag.html#SKIP_CACHE_LOAD[SKIP_CACHE_LOAD].
So, if you're using either of these flags in your Infinispan client
codebase, we highly recommend that from Infinispan 5.2.0.Alpha3 you
start using
http://docs.jboss.org/infinispan/5.2/apidocs/org/infinispan/context/Flag.html#IGNORE_RETURN_VALUES[IGNORE_RETURN_VALUES]
instead.
