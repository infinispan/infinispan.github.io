= Infinispan 12.0.0.Dev01

Dear Infinispan community,

The first of our development releases of Infinispan 12 is here and it features our upgrade to https://hibernate.org/search/[Hibernate Search 6] which finally allows us to upgrade to https://lucene.apache.org/[Lucene 8.x]. We've had to change a few things in our query implementation to accommodate the latest and greatest and to make the feature simpler to use. As expected, being a development release, there are some rough edges and we'd really love *YOUR* help in making sure that we get everything right for the final release later this year.

You can look at the https://issues.redhat.com/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?projectId=12310799&version=12346555[release notes] to see what has changed.

We're hard at work on new features, improvements and fixes, so watch this space for more announcements!
