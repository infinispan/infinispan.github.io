== 

Dear Infinispan users, we thought CR3 was going to be the last candidate
release before Final... but we were mistaken!

The reason for yet another CR is that we decided to make some changes
which affect some default behaviours:

* enabling optimistic transactions with repeatable read now turns on
write-skew by default
* retrieving an already configured cache by passing in a template
doesn't redefine that cache's configuration

Other important changes:

* big improvements to the client/server rolling upgrade process
* allow indexes to be stored in off-heap caches
* lots of bug fixes

For the full list of changes check the
https://issues.jboss.org/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?projectId=12310799&version=12334143[release
notes], http://infinispan.org/download/[download] the 9.0.0.CR4 release
and http://infinispan.org/community/[let us know] if you have any
questions or suggestions.

Cheers,
The Infinispan team
