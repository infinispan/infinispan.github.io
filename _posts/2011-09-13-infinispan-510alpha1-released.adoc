Having released Infinispan 5.0.1.FINAL yesterday, today is the turn of
releasing Infinispan 5.1.0.ALPHA1 _"Brahma"_. This is the first in a
series of alpha releases which will give Infinispan users the chance to
play with the newest features. Here're some highlights of what's
included in this release:


* Thanks to Israel Lacerra, Infinispan now supports fully distributed
queries which allows queries to be parallelised across all nodes.
Creating a distributed query is very easy, simply call
http://docs.jboss.org/infinispan/5.1/apidocs/org/infinispan/query/SearchManager.html#getClusteredQuery(org.apache.lucene.search.Query,%20java.lang.Class...)[SearchManager.getClusteredQuery].
Please note that this feature is experimental and the API is likely to
change before the final release.
* Infnispan Query module uses Hibernate Search 4 now.
* In Infinispan 5.0, we introduced the possibility of executing
operations against a cache in such way that class loading could occur
with a user-provided classloader. In this new release, we've extended
the use case to allow data that's stored in binary format to be
unmarshalled with the given classloader. This is particularly handy for
those users that are deploying Infinispan in modular, or OSGI-like
environments. For more information, check
http://docs.jboss.org/infinispan/5.1/apidocs/org/infinispan/AdvancedCache.html#with(java.lang.ClassLoader)[AdvancedCache.with(ClassLoader)
API].

Please keep the feedback coming, and as always, you can download the
release from here and you get further details on the issues addressed in
the changelog.



By the way, remember that members of the Infinispan team will be
speaking in events such as
