https://bitbucket.org/ssmoot[Sam Smoot] has recently compared the
performance of Infinispan versus Hazelcast both with default cache
settings and posted
https://bitbucket.org/ssmoot/scala-map-benchmarks[some interesting
performance results with Infinispan coming on top] :)



@Sam, we hear you and we're working on reducing the number of JARs
required for standalone, default use case :)

Cheers,
Galder
