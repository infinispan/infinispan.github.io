Over the past few years we've been blogging a lot on how to use
Infinispan in cloud environments based on
https://infinispan.org/blog/search/label/docker[Docker],
https://infinispan.org/blog/search/label/kubernetes[Kubernetes] or
https://infinispan.org/blog/search/label/openshift[OpenShift].

Continuing with this series of blog posts,
http://www.jgroups.org/members.html[Bela Ban], chief-in-charge of
JGroups, posted an unmissable blog post yesterday not only how to run
Infinispan with Kubernetes on
https://cloud.google.com/container-engine/[Google Container Engine
(GKE)], but also how to load test it with
https://github.com/belaban/IspnPerfTest[IspnPerfTest].

If any of these topics interests you, don't miss out and head to Bela's
blog to

all about it]!

Thanks Bela for the blog post!!!
