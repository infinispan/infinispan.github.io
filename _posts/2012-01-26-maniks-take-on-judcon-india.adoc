JUDCon has, for the first time ever, spread beyond the western world.
http://www.jboss.org/events/JUDCon/2012/india[JUDCon India], held on
Tuesday and Wednesday this week, was a roaring success with over 800
passionate community members flocking to the event held in Bangalore,
India's answer to California's silicon valley.

One of the themes was developer productivity and engagement, to help
community members get more involved in the projects they care about, to
help them succeed in their businesses with JBoss technology.

JBoss AS 7, NoSQL and platform-as-a-service were a few of the popular
themes, and there were no less than 6 talks on infinispan in just two
days, presented by myself and
https://community.jboss.org/people/galder.zamarreno[Galder Zamarre√±o].
The talks ranged from high level overviews and roadmaps to detailed,
hands-on hacking sessions, as well as presenting thoughts and ideas for
future development.

All in, an excellent community conference, well organised by
http://www.saltmarch.com/[Saltmarch Media], and very well received by
the community. I for one look forward to another JUDCon in Bangalore in
the hopefully not too distant future.

Cheers
Manik
