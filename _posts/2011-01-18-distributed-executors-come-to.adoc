I'm delighted to announce the release of Infinispan 5.0.0.ALPHA2 that
includes the very first version of
http://community.jboss.org/docs/DOC-15622[Infinispan's Distributed
Executor Framework]. Make sure you have a look at the javadocs for the
http://docs.jboss.org/infinispan/5.0/apidocs/org/infinispan/distexec/package-summary.html[distributed
executor package] and the
http://docs.jboss.org/infinispan/5.0/apidocs/org/infinispan/distexec/mapreduce/package-summary.html[map/reduce
package]. Watch out for a forthcoming blog entry from Vladimir with
plenty more information and examples!



On top of this, http://community.jboss.org/docs/DOC-16198[the mechanism
to plug user-defined externalizers] has changed for ALPHA2 based on
invaluable feedback from the community, making it easier for third party
applications to abstract Infinispan's Externalizer framework and hide it
from end users. From ALPHA2 onwards, Infinispan Lucene directory
provides its own
http://docs.jboss.org/infinispan/5.0/apidocs/org/infinispan/marshall/Externalizer.html[Externalizer]
implementations and so expect a performance improvement in the RPC calls
it mades.



As usual Infinispan 5.0.0.ALPHA2 is available for download from
http://www.jboss.org/infinispan/downloads[here], issues fixed can be
found
https://issues.jboss.org/secure/IssueNavigator.jspa?reset=true&jqlQuery=project+%3D+ISPN+AND+fixVersion+%3D+%225.0.0.ALPHA2%22[here],
and provide feedback
http://community.jboss.org/en/infinispan?view=discussions[here].



Cheers,

Galder
