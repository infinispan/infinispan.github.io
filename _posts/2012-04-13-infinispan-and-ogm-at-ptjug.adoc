http://codingobsession.blogspot.co.uk/[Sanne Grinovero] and myself will
talk about http://www.jboss.org/infinispan/[Infinispan] and
http://www.hibernate.org/subprojects/ogm.html[OGM] at Portugal JUG
http://www.java.pt/node/293[in Coimbra on the April 18]. This join talk
covers an introduction to http://www.jboss.org/infinispan/[Infinispan]
and its main use cases followed by a presentation about NoSQL and
Hibernate http://www.hibernate.org/subprojects/ogm.html[OGM]. Thanks to

looking forward to meet with the community!



Cheers,
