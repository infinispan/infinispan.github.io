Let's continue our excursus into the security features that are being
developed within Infinispan 7.0 by having a look at how our
high-performance cache remoting protocol HotRod was enhanced to support
authentication.

Since Infinispan 5.3, HotRod has featured SSL/TLS support which, aside
from encryption, also provides some form of authentication by optionally
requiring client certificates. While this does indeed stop unauthorized
clients from connecting to a remote cache, the level of access-control
ends there. Now that we have full role-based authorization checks at the
cache and container level, we want to be able to recognize users and map
their roles accordingly.

As usual, we didn't want to reinvent the wheel, but leverage existing
security frameworks and integrate them into our existing platform. For
this reason, the protocol chosen to implement HotRod authentication is
SASL, which is in widespread use in other connection-oriented transports
(e.g. LDAP, Memached, etc).

Using SASL we can support the following authentication mechanisms out of
the box (since they are part of the standard JDK/JRE):

* PLAIN where credentials are exchanged in clear-text (insecure, but
easieast to setup)
* DIGEST-MD5 where credentials are hashed using server-provided nonces
* GSSAPI where clients can use Kerberos tokens
* EXTERNAL where the client-certificate identity of the underlying
transport is used as the credentials

More SASL mechanisms can be plugged in by using the Java Cryptography
Archictecture (JCA).

Since our preferred server distribution is based on a stripped-down
WildFly server, we are essentially reusing the Security Realms of the
container. This gives us the ability to validate users and to also
retrieve group membership. against a number of sources (property files,
LDAP, etc).

The following is an example server configuration which uses the
_ApplicationRealm_ to authenticate and authorize users. Since the
_<identity-role-mapper>_ is in use, role names will be mapped 1:1 from
the realm into Infinispan roles.
The HotRod endpoint is using the SASL PLAIN mechanism. Note that two
caches have been defined: the _default_ cache, without authorization,
and a _secured_ cache, which instead requires authorization. This means
that remote clients can access the _default_ cache anonymously, but they
will need to authenticate if they want to access the _secured_ cache.


The following bit of code explains how to use the HotRod Java client to
connect to the secured cache defined above:

All of the above is already available in Infinispan 7.0.0.Alpha5, so

experience the goodness.
