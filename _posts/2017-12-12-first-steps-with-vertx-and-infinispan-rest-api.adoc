Welcome to the first in a multi-part series of blog posts about creating
http://vertx.io/[Eclipse Vert.x] applications with
http://infinispan.org/[Infinispan]. The purpose of this first tutorial
is to showcase how to create a REST API.

________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
_All the code of this tutorial is available in this
https://github.com/infinispan-demos/vertx-api[GitHub repository]. The
backend is a Java project using https://maven.apache.org/[Maven], so all
the needed dependencies can be found in the pom.xml._

== What is Vert.x ?

http://vertx.io/[Vert.x] is a tool-kit for building reactive
applications on the JVM. It’s an event driven and non blocking tool-kit.
It is based on the
http://vertx.io/docs/vertx-core/java/#_reactor_and_multi_reactor[Reactor
Pattern], like Node.js, but unlike Node it can easily use all the cores
of your machine so you can create highly concurrent and performant
applications. Code examples can be found
https://github.com/vert-x3/vertx-examples[in this repository].

== 



== REST API

Let’s start creating a simple endpoint that will display a welcome
message on '/'. In Vert.x this is done by creating a
*http://vertx.io/docs/vertx-core/java/#_verticles[Verticle]*. A verticle
is a unit of deployment and processes incoming events over an
event-loop. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event_loop[Event-loops] are
used in asynchronous programming models. I won't spend more time here
explaining these concepts as this is very well done in this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qL5BGHPXrac[Devoxx Vert.x talk] or in
the documentation available
http://vertx.io/docs/guide-for-java-devs/[here].

We need to override the start method, create a 'router' so '/' requests
can be handled, and finally create a http server.

The most important thing to remember about vert.x, is that *we can NEVER
EVER call blocking code* (we will see how to deal with blocking API's
just after). If we do so, we will
http://vertx.io/docs/vertx-core/java/#golden_rule[block the event loop]
and we won't be able to serve incoming requests properly.




Run the main method, go to your browser to http://localhost:8081/ and we
see the welcome message !


=== Connecting with Infinispan


Now we are going to create a *REST API* that uses Infinispan. The
purpose here is to post and get names by id. We are going to use the
default cache in Infinispan for this example, and we will connect to it
remotely. To do that, we are going to use the
http://infinispan.org/hotrod-clients/[Infinispan hotrod protocol], which
is the recommended way to do it (but we could use
http://infinispan.org/docs/9.0.x/infinispan_server_guide/infinispan_server_guide.html#_rest[REST]
or
http://infinispan.org/docs/9.0.x/infinispan_server_guide/infinispan_server_guide.html#_memcached[Memcached]
protocol too)


==== Start Infinispan locally

The first thing we are going to do is to run an Infinispan Server
locally. We download the Infinispan Server from
http://downloads.jboss.org/infinispan/9.1.3.Final/infinispan-server-9.1.3.Final-bin.zip[here],
unzip the downloaded file and run ./bin/standalone.sh. 

__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
_If you are using Docker on Linux, you can use the
Ihttps://hub.docker.com/r/jboss/infinispan-server/[nfinispan Docker
Image Available] easily. If you are using Docker for Mac, at the time of
this writing there is an issue with internal IP addresses and they can't
be called externally. Different workarounds exist to solve the problem,
but the easiest thing for this example is simply downloading and running
the standalone server locally. We will see how to use the docker image
in Openshift just after._
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

The hotrod server is listening in localhost:11222.

==== Connect the client to the server

The code we need to connect with Infinispan from our java application is
the following :




This code *is blocking*. As I said before, *we can't block the event
loop* and this will happen if we directly call these API's from a
verticle. The code must be called using
http://vertx.io/docs/vertx-core/java/#blocking_code[vertx.executeBlocking]
method, and passing a Handler. The code in the handler will be executed
from a worker thread pool and will pass the result back
asynchronously.
Instead of overriding the start method, we are going to
override start(Future<Void> startFuture). This way, we are going to be
able to handle errors.

To stop the client, the API supplies a non blocking method that can be
called when the verticle is stopped, so we are safe on that.

We are going to create an abstract CacheAccessVerticle where we will
initialise the manager and get default cache. When everything is correct
and the defautCache variable is initialised, we will log a message and
execute the initSuccess abstract method.




=== REST API to create names


We are going to add 3 new endpoints.

* GET /api displays the API name
* POST /api/cutenames creates a new name
* GET /api/cutenames/id displays a name by id

CuteNamesRestAPI verticle can now extend this class and override
the initSuccess method instead of the start method.





==== POST

Our goal is to use a curl to create a name like this :


curl -X POST \ 
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '\{"name":"Oihana"}' "http://localhost:8081/api/cutenames"

....
....

______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
_For those that are not familiar with basques names, Oihana means
'rainforest' and is a super cute name. Those who know me will confirm
that I'm absolutely not biased making this statement._
______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

To read the body content, we need to *add a body handler* to the route,
otherwise the body won't be parsed. This is done by
calling router.route().handler(BodyHandler.create()).

The handler that will handle the post method in '/api/cutenames' is a
RoutingContext handler. We want to create a new name in the default
cache. For that, we will call putAsync method from the *defaultCache*.





The server responds 201 when the name is correctly created, and 400 when
the request is not correct.


==== GET by id

To create a get endpoint by id, we need to declare a route that will
take a parameter :id. In the route handler, we are going to call
getAsync method.




If we run the main, we can POST and GET names using curl !

 curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
 -d '\{"id":"42", "name":"Oihana"}' \ 
"http://localhost:8081/api/cutenames" 

*Cute name added *

 curl -X GET -H "Content-Type: application/json" \ 
"http://localhost:8081/api/cutenames/42"
*
\{"name":"Oihana"}*

== Wrap up

We have learned how to create a REST API with Vert.x, powered by
Infinispan. The repository has some unit tests using the
http://vertx.io/docs/vertx-web-client/java/[web client]. Feedback is
more than welcome to improve the code and the provided examples. I hope
you enjoyed this tutorial ! On the next tutorial you will learn how to
create a

API].
