Modern applications and microservices often need to expose their health
status. A common example is
https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current-SNAPSHOT/reference/htmlsingle/#production-ready[Spring
Actuator] but there are also many different ways of doing that. 



Starting from Infinispan 9.0.0.Beta2 we introduced the
http://infinispan.org/docs/dev/user_guide/user_guide.html#monitoring_cluster_health[HealthCheck
API]. It is accessible in both Embedded and Client/Server mode. 



== Cluster Health and Embedded Mode



The HealthCheck API might be obtained directly from EmbeddedCacheManager
and it looks like this:





The nice thing about the API is that it is exposed in JMX by default:

More information about using HealthCheck API in Embedded Mode might be
found here:

== Cluster Health and Server Mode



Since Infinispan is based on Wildfly, we decided to use CLI as well as
built-in
https://docs.jboss.org/author/display/WFLY10/The+HTTP+management+API[Management
REST] interface.



Here's an example of checking the status of a running server:





Querying the HealthCheck API using the Management REST is also very
simple:





Note that for the REST endpoint, you have to use proper credentials.

== Cluster Health and Kubernetes/OpenShift


Monitoring cluster health is crucial for Clouds Platforms such as
Kubernetes and OpenShift. Those Clouds use a concept of immutable Pods.
This means that every time you need change anything in your application
(changing configuration for the instance), you need to replace the old
instances with new ones. There are several ways of doing that but we
highly recommend using
https://docs.openshift.org/latest/dev_guide/deployments/deployment_strategies.html#when-to-use-a-rolling-deployment[Rolling
Updates]. We also recommend to tune the configuration and instruct
Kubernetes/OpenShift to replace Pods one by one (I will show you an
example in a moment). 



Our goal is to configure Kubernetes/OpenShift in such a way, that each
time a new Pod is joining or leaving the cluster a
https://github.com/infinispan/infinispan/wiki/Non-Blocking-State-Transfer-V2[State
Transfer] is triggered. When data is being transferred between the
nodes, the
https://docs.openshift.org/latest/dev_guide/application_health.html[Readiness
Probe] needs to report failures and prevent Kubernetes/OpenShift from
doing progress in Rolling Update procedure. Once the cluster is back in
stable state, Kubernetes/OpenShift can replace another node. This
process loops until all nodes are replaced. 



Luckily, we introduced two scripts in our Docker image, which can be
used out of the box for Liveness and Readiness Probes:

* https://github.com/jboss-dockerfiles/infinispan/blob/master/server/is_healthy.sh[/usr/local/bin/is_healthy.sh]
* https://github.com/jboss-dockerfiles/infinispan/blob/master/server/is_running.sh[/usr/local/bin/is_running.sh]

At this point we are ready to put all the things together and assemble
DeploymentConfig:





Interesting parts of the configuration:

* *lines 13 and 14:* We allocate additional capacity for the Rolling
Update and allow one Pod to be down. This ensures Kubernetes/OpenShift
replaces nodes one by one.
* *line 44:* Sometimes shutting a Pod down takes a little while. It is
always better to wait until it terminates gracefully than taking the
risk of losing data.
* *lines 45 - 53:* The Liveness Probe definition. Note that when a node
is transferring the data it might highly occupied. It is wise to set
higher value of '_failureThreshold_'.
* *lines 54 - 62:* The same rule as the above. The bigger the cluster
is, the higher the value of '_successThreshold_' as well as
'_failureThreshold_'.
