Yep, I've just cut Infinispan 4.2.0.CR4.  This is the last release
candidate before a final release, so here is your chance to have your
say.  :-)  A few stability issues around rehashing and distributed
locking/transactions have been resolved, so please do try this out.

Details of issues fixed are
