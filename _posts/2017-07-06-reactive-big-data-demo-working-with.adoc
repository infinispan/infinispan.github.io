A couple of months ago I did an
http://blog.infinispan.org/2017/05/reactive-big-data-on-openshift-in.html[extensive
blog post] on a reactive Big Data demo I did for
http://www.developermarch.com/developersummit/[Great Indian Developer
Summit]. At the time, the demo relied on a custom Infinispan build which
fixed https://issues.jboss.org/browse/ISPN-7814[ISPN-7814] and
https://issues.jboss.org/browse/ISPN-7710[ISPN-7710] issues.

These issues are now fixed in the main repository and the 9.0.x branch,
and so you can now run the demo, as is, using Infinispan 9.0.3.Final.
I've
https://github.com/infinispan-demos/swiss-transport-datagrid/commit/e3a35799cb24b5005f9b7201fc0bed18f5fa50f2[updated
the demo] so that it uses this version.

Cheers,
