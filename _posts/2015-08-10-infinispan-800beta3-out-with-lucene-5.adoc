Infinispan 8.0.0.Beta3 is out with a lot of new bells and whistles
including:


* Infinispan querying has been upgraded to be usable with Lucene 5, with
a lot of improvements particularly in terms of memory efficiency. With
this upgrade, Lucene 4 support has been removed from the community
project.
* Configuration templates are finally here, meaning that users can now
define cache configurations as template configurations, and then create
cache configurations using those templates as base configuration.
* A brand new, experimental,
https://github.com/infinispan/infinispan/blob/6e32d6d53d3096bdcabef4a1cb97c70fbe7d15c3/commons/src/main/java/org/infinispan/commons/api/functional/FunctionalMap.java[FunctionalMap]
API has been added that takes advantage of the lambda and async
programming improvements introduced in Java 8. We consider this an
advanced API that will enable Infinispan to grow beyond the well known
javax.cache.Cache and java.util.concurrent.ConcurrentMap APIs. In the
next few days I'll be posting mutiple, detailed, blog posts looking at
the different aspects of the API. If you area eager to get started, you
can first have a look at
https://github.com/infinispan/infinispan/blob/6e32d6d53d3096bdcabef4a1cb97c70fbe7d15c3/core/src/test/java/org/infinispan/functional/decorators/FunctionalConcurrentMap.java[a
ConcurrentMap implementation using FunctionalMap] to get a feel for it.
Your feedback is highly appreciated!
* Pedro has completed ISPN-2849 which should provide much better
performance by liberating precious JGroups threads from having to wait
for locks to be acquired remotely.

Happy hacking :)
