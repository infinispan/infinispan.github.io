Dear Infinispan Community,

The Infinispan team is pleased to share the follow up article published on the Red Hat Developer blog.

Part two of a two-part series of articles, this blog post focuses on how
the https://infinispan.org/docs/infinispan-operator/master/operator.html[Infinispan Operator] was used to create
all the configuration and deployment descriptors for the online hybrid-cloud Battleship game that featured
at this year's Red Hat Summit Keynote.

*You can read the blog post https://developers.redhat.com/articles/2021/06/08/create-and-manage-red-hat-data-grid-services-hybrid-cloud[here]*

The Infinispan Operator is available from the https://operatorhub.io/operator/infinispan[Operator Hub].

Enjoy your reading!
