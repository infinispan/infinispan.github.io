We're back from http://www.devoxx.com/display/DV09/Home[Devoxx 2009],
and thanks to Stephan et al for organising an excellent event. There
were some brilliant talks, especially on performance tuning, JDK7 and
Scala. And of course Infinspan. :)

Once the recording of my talk on Infinispan is up on
http://beta.parleys.com/#st=4&id=74957[Parleys.com], I'll link to it
here. But for now, you should check out this PODcast interview I did
with Chariot Solutions' Ken Rimple a couple of weeks back -

Enjoy,
