I've just cut Infinispan 4.1.0.ALPHA3, codenamed _Radegast_.  This
release contains a number of fixes and bugs reported in 4.0.0
_Starobrno_ as well as earlier alphas, and is quite likely to be the
last alpha before a feature-complete 4.1.0.BETA1 is released.

A detailed
https://jira.jboss.org/jira/secure/ConfigureReport.jspa?versions=12314871&sections=.1.7.2.4.10.9.8.3.12.11.5&style=none&selectedProjectId=12310799&reportKey=pl.net.mamut:releasenotes&Next=Next[changelog]
is available.  The release is downloadable in the
http://www.jboss.org/infinispan/downloads[usual place].

If you use Maven, please note, we now use the new JBoss Nexus-based
Maven repository.  The Maven coordinates for Infinispan are still the
same (groud id _org.infinispan_, artifact id _infinispan-core_, etc) but
the repository you need to point to has changed.  Setting up your Maven
settings.xml is described
http://community.jboss.org/wiki/MavenGettingStarted-Users[here].

Enjoy!
