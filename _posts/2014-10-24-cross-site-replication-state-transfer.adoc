Hello community.

Since the initial release of Cross-Site Replication, the state transfer
between sites was really needed. When a new site is brought online,
there was not way to synchronize the data between them. Finally, these
days are over and it is possible synchronize geographically replicated
sites. How to use is described in
http://infinispan.org/docs/7.0.x/user_guide/user_guide.html#_state_transfer_between_sites[Infinispan's
Manual].

For the curious, the solution is
described https://github.com/infinispan/infinispan/wiki/Design-For-Cross-Site-Replication#state-transfer-between-sites-version-2[here].

Any question can be asked in
the https://developer.jboss.org/en/infinispan/content?filterID=contentstatus%5Bpublished%5D~objecttype~objecttype%5Bthread%5D[forum],
mailing list or directly with us in
the irc://irc.freenode.org/infinispan[IRC]. If you found a bug please
report it in https://issues.jboss.org/browse/ISPN/[here].

Happy coding, fellows.

Infinispan Team.
